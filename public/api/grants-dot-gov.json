The Plant Conservation Program provides leadership in identifying, maintaining, and restoring Western native plant communities on public lands. Public lands contain a diversity of wildlife that need habitat of native plant communities comprised of over 50 ecoregions across BLM administered lands. Each ecoregion contains native plants that have adapted to those environments.

FDA is collaborating with medical device stakeholders to build the National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST) NEST will support the sustainable generation and use of timely, reliable, and cost-effective Real-World Evidence (RWE) by leveraging clinical registries in addition to the other data sources such as electronic health records (EHRs), pharmacies, public and private claims, and patient-generated data. Since in the world of medical devices today, clinical registries collect and maintain detailed, curated clinical data on millions of patients receiving diagnostics and treatments involving health technologies, they can provide critical infrastructure that can be used for a variety of analyses related to real-world patient care and outcomes. To address some of the inherent and modifiable limitations of the registries, the model of strategically Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs) was recommended by the National Medical Device Registry Task Force (NMDRTF) and further developed by Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet).  Following the recommendations of the NMDRF, several CRNs have been rapidly developing. More recently MDEpiNet launched the CRN Community of Practice (COP), a partnership of national registries aspiring to evolve into CRNs, that engages a wide variety of stakeholders to ensure that high value data is generated by CRNs including patient organizations, health care providers, regulators, payors, health services researchers, health technology manufacturers, software vendors, health exchanges and local, state, national and international government agencies and could also be used in social determinants of health and other local and state initiatives. This learning community, coordinated by MDEpiNet Coordinating Center (MDEpiNetcc), uniquely integrates multi-stakeholder’s views and patient perspectives with harmonization and interoperability to address an important unmet need in the country, especially for conducting research on conditions and treatments that though clinically valuable, require continued evaluation of safety and effectiveness evidence as it evolves throughout the total product life cycle.  The main goal of this FOA is to advance infrastructure and methodology research to promote evolution of traditional registries into mature CRNs contributing a reliable, relevant and timely data on health technologies. Specific Aims are: (1) Facilitate coordination and maturation of Coordinated Registry Networks (CRN) Community of Practice; (2) Develop and test drive novel methods in CRN science and surveillance by leveraging big data analytics; (3) Augment CRNs by linking registries to other data sources (including administrative claims, electronic health records, patient generated data, and other available data sources; (4) Collaborate with NEST partners and others to advance capacity of FDA to address complex health technology-related questions.  This will result in a more strategic approach to addressing the needs of the entire patient-centered medical device ecosystem, via harmonized and interoperable infrastructure that will allow for more complex study designs and analyses. Capturing standardized data will streamline data collection and support exchange of data across therapies, patient populations and episodes of care. For example, by including Unique Device Identification (UDI) in the CRN minimum core data set, the CRNs become suitable for routinely studying device-specific questions; by including patient-generated data in CRN, the research community can link the patient experiences to clinical data sources and regulators can identify how devices are performing for patients and identify patient-centric endpoints for future studies; and by linking registry data to additional data sources (such as medical claims submitted by providers to bill for medical services), patients and providers can have a more comprehensive understanding of long-term outcomes and adverse events associated with health technologies that are important for reaching informed decisions.  All applications developed to address this announcement should consider the following points:  1. The existing CRN Community of Practice (COP) should continue to support transparency such that patients, physicians, hospitals, insurers, medical device industry, and regulatory bodies will have access to and be able to replicate any given analysis; 2. Applications should leverage the existing partnerships to advance data access and availability to all stakeholders and partners, including FDA (for research purposes as well as for Total Product Life Cycle evaluation); 3. Applications should include details on how patient privacy and data security will be established and maintained; 4. Applications should incorporate use of Unique Device Identification (UDI) to allow for adequate tracking and investigation into potential postmarket signals; 5. The methods and infrastructure systems developed should be capable of being applied more broadly across the medical device landscape; 6. Methodology and infrastructure development efforts should address the needs of multiple CRNs and their stakeholders across clinical areas; and 7. The scientific plan for developing the CRNs should be accompanied by a plan or framework for establishing a sustainable partnership business infrastructure to allow for substantial national or international coverage over an extended period."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit, Great Lakes Northern Forests CESU","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323642","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>G20AS00030</b>","contentSnippet":"G20AS00030","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323642","categories":["ST|Science and Technology and other Research and Development"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323642"},{"opportunity-number":"G20AS00030"},{"opportunity-title":"Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit, Great Lakes Northern Forests CESU"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Science and Technology and other Research and Development"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"15.808"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"This financial assistance opportunity is being issued under a   Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit (CESU) Program.

The work performed by CRF helps the Park in meeting the legislated goals of protecting and conserving OZAR's natural and cultural features. The Cave Research Foundation (CRF) recruits many volunteers for various cave related projects. Although many of these volunteers have specialized cave/karst related experience, many of them have not been to the park. Their direct participation in projects allows the opportunity for them to experience the park’s free-flowing spring-fed Current and/or Jacks Fork Rivers via canoe or kayak while also enjoying the ecological beauty of the rugged forested hills and cave systems. Biological inventories and cave restoration further allow us to gain valuable knowledge about our cave ecosystems. Such information is incorporated into a state-wide cave life database, educational brochures, newsletters, articles (i.e. Inside Earth), and research projects. CRF will conduct a variety of scientific research projects related to caves and karst (i.e. biological inventories, long-term monitoring, conferences, meetings, and White-Nose Syndrome monitoring), assist in the conservation of cave and karst resources (i.e. cave gating, repair to caves that have been vandalized, provide technical and educational expertise related to cave/karst management decisions, etc.), and assist in interpretation of these natural and cultural resources through education outreach (i.e. educational articles, brochures, research publications, and cave tours at Round Spring). The OZAR Terrestrial Ecologist works jointly and extensively with the CRF in developing annual work plans, new projects, and educational materials, articles and/or journal entries. OZAR consults with CRF in order to gain knowledge on specific cave history, natural/cultural significance, biological significance, priority needs, and/or vandalism issues as they pertain to NEPA scoping for various projects. CRF duties include: annual monitoring and surveying biota of selected caves, cave mapping, general cave management activities such as designing and installing cave gates, restoring cave floors in conjunction with cultural resource specialists, writing cave restoration project statements for funding, writing articles per request of OZAR staff related to cave geology/biota, assisting staff with annual bio inventories of Federally Threatened and Endangered bat species, provide technical and expertise for compliance; maintains State's Cave Life Database, recruits volunteers and cooperative partners."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"U.S. Embassy Havana Public Affairs Grants Program","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322628","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>PAS-HAVANA-FY20-01</b>","contentSnippet":"PAS-HAVANA-FY20-01","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322628","categories":["O|Other (see text field entitled \"Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity\" for clarification)"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"opportunity-id":"322628"},{"opportunity-number":"PAS-HAVANA-FY20-01"},{"opportunity-title":"U.S. Embassy Havana Public Affairs Grants Program"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Other (see text field entitled \"Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity\" for clarification)"},{"category-explanation":"CFDA Number(s):19.040 Public Diplomacy Programs"},{"cfda-numbers":"19.040"},{"eligible-applicants":"Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationIndividuals"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"N/A"},{"agency-code":"DOS-CUB"},{"agency-name":"Department of StateU.S. Mission to Cuba"},{"posted-date":"Jan 28, 2020"},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 28, 2020"},{"estimated-synopsis-post-date":""},{"fiscal-year":"2020"},{"award-ceiling":""},{"award-floor":"$10,000"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":""},{"expected-number-of-awards":"10"},{"description":"The Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in Havana is pleased to announce funding availability through its Public Diplomacy Small Grants Program.

These activities have resulted in over 95% of newborns screened and improved early identification of deaf or hard of hearing (D/HH) infants. Even with these successes the capabilities of the EHDI-IS vary and some infants are not documented as having received recommended follow-up diagnostic testing and intervention services. Ensuring that follow-up services are provided is essential in meeting the needs of children who are D/HH and increasing the impact of state EHDI programs. A key goal of the EHDI program is to ensure that children who are D/HH develop language skills commensurate with their hearing peers by kindergarten. This begins with early diagnosis and timely enrollment into intervention services. “Early” is defined as being identified before three months of age and enrolled in intervention services before six months of age. The timely receipt of diagnostic and intervention services is made possible in part by jurisdictions using their CDC-funded EHDI-IS to actively track infants to make sure they receive essential screening, diagnostic, and intervention services. This new NOFO aims to continue to advance the system's capacity by optimizing jurisdictions’ existing EHDI-IS and expanding their ability to report, analyze, and use patient-level data. This will include supporting states to: Report patient-level data on all occurrent births (excluding direct identifiers) Refine existing tracking and surveillance practices Optimize EHDI-IS functionality to support data collection, tracking and documentation of follow-up diagnostic and intervention services Strengthen capacity for timely reporting and analysis of data to support real-time decision making by state programs"},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"Buenos Aires English for Journalists and Disinformation","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323658","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>PAS-AR200-FY20-02</b>","contentSnippet":"PAS-AR200-FY20-02","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323658","categories":["ED|Education"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323658"},{"opportunity-number":"PAS-AR200-FY20-02"},{"opportunity-title":"Buenos Aires English for Journalists and Disinformation"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Education"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"19.040"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Accredited public institutions of higher education; private institutions of higher education; curriculum developers; educators of journalism and university systems in the United States or Argentina."},{"agency-code":"DOS-ARG"},{"agency-name":"Department of StateU.S. Mission to Argentina"},{"posted-date":"Jan 14, 2020"},{"close-date":"Mar 13, 2020"},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 14, 2020"},{"award-ceiling":"$35,000"},{"award-floor":"$35,000"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":"$35,000"},{"expected-number-of-awards":"1"},{"description":"Creation of a curriculum for English language students of intermediate and advanced ability to study both English and journalism,  based on the UNESCO publication Journalism, 'Fake News' and Disinformation: A Handbook for Journalism Education and Training (“Curriculum”).    I. STATEMENT OF WORK  The Curriculum has 7 Units and includes these topics:   Truth, Trust and Journalism: Why it Matters Thinking about \"Information Disorder\": Formats of Misinformation, Disinformation and Mal-information  News Industry Transformation: Digital Technology, Social Platforms and the Spread of Misinformation and Disinformation  Combatting Disinformation and Misinformation Through Media and Information Literacy (MIL) Fact-Checking 101 Social Media Verification: Assessing Sources and Visual Content Combatting Online Abuse: When Journalists and Their Sources are Targeted     The applicant shall convert the UNESCO materials to a curriculum for English language students, for the benefit of primary Spanish speaking journalists, academics and editors, Spanish speakers, with intermediate and advanced proficiency in English who seek to improve their language skills and their general understanding of the risks of disinformation, and the need for news organizations to counter it collaboratively with its readership, based on U.S. models of journalism experience, to explore how traditional and digital media outlets can take proactive roles in combatting disinformation. Additional information can be found in the following link: https://en.unesco.org/fightfakenews       II. PROGRAM SPECIFIC GUIDELINES    Each activity in the Curriculum, from reading passages to interactive activities to discussion topics, should address two learning levels: Intermediate and Advanced. The Curriculum should be divided in 2 modules of 10 classes of three hours of classtime, 1 hour of online lab per class, and three hours of homework for each of the 20 classes.      A combination of classroom instruction and technology in a flexible approach to learning that recognizes the benefits of delivering some training and assessment online but also uses other modes to make up a complete training program which can improve learning outcomes.     Grantee’s responsibilities:      Design and plan a Curriculum including 20 classes on disinformation in English designed for Journalists. Provide a welcome orientation to serve as an introduction to the program and its objectives as well as an introduction to the host country. Provide a closing session to summarize program activities and plan for their future as alumni. Present creative and effective ways to address program themes, for both program participants and their peers to amplify program impact. Design and implement an evaluation plan that assesses the program’s impact, such as a post-course distribution list or social media group.       The grantee through this grant will design the program that will later might be conducted by a different third-party institution to be decided by the U.S. Embassy’s Public Affairs Section in Argentina.      The free press is under a conflagration of pressures in Argentina as in much of the world, and its ability to keep supporting democracy will be determined by its capability to navigate those pressures. These challenges include the onslaught of unreliable information in the age of social media, the economic strain of the shift from print journalism, and the rise of heated anti-press rhetoric. This program will present a unique opportunity to help media outlets to understand the implications of these changes for journalists, including how they distinguish themselves, build trust, acquire new skills, verify information and push back against misinformation.   At the same time, the program will give journalists a key tool to help them do a better job. In a Spanish-speaking country, improving English language skills helps journalists communicate with interlocutors abroad (when traveling to cover any story or event), and gives them access to more sources of information and databases."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"Site Work at Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural NHS","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323659","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>NPS-20-REG1-0003</b>","contentSnippet":"NPS-20-REG1-0003","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323659","categories":["ELT|Employment, Labor and Training"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323659"},{"opportunity-number":"NPS-20-REG1-0003"},{"opportunity-title":"Site Work at Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural NHS"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Employment, Labor and Training"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"15.954"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"This announcement is not a request for applications.

The work funded through this program is aimed at promoting long-term survival of corals by supporting the science needed to incorporate resilient corals into restoration activities and to enhance the efficiency of asexual and sexual coral restoration. The principal objectives of this grant program are to support innovative coral restoration research, to apply these innovative techniques to create resilient, genetically diverse, and reproductively viable populations of coral species, and to support the development of creative methods to improve coral outplanting efficiency and build resilient coral reef ecosystems. Projects funded through the Ruth Gates Restoration Innovation Grants will support: 1) research and development of interventions to improve coral resilience to environmental stressors, and 2) research, development, and field-testing of novel techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of coral population enhancement. Proposals selected for funding through this solicitation will be funded through cooperative agreements. One-year or multi-year awards up to three funding years will be considered. The funding for the second and/or third year (FY21 and/or FY22) will be estimated in the FY20 application, with final amounts determined in future years, pending future federal appropriations and progress towards project milestones. Proposals for multi-year funding should outline the costs expected for year two and/or year three in detail in this proposal (see Section IV.B for more details about the budget narrative for multi-year awards). NOAA anticipates typical federal funding for awards will range from $100,000-$250,000/year for a total $100,000 to $750,000 over one to three years. NOAA will not accept proposals with a federal funding request of less than $100,000 or more than $1,000,000 total over three years. NOAA anticipates approximately $500,000 will be available under this Announcement in FY20. Funds will be administered by the Office of Habitat Conservation in conjunction with the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP). Funding may be divided among the U.S. Pacific and Atlantic regions to maintain the geographic balance of the CRCP FY20 portfolio overall, as required by the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. NOAA anticipates an additional $500,000 to $1,500,000 may be available in the next two years (FY21 - FY22) to support selected awards.

Major complications of SCD include anemia, debilitating pain, infection, stroke, and organ damage. Poor health outcomes may be a result of limited or no access to comprehensive care, especially during their adult years, and limited treatment options. There is no national surveillance of SCD. Consequently, there are large gaps in our current understanding of the natural course of the disease and its variable manifestations from one patient to the next. There is also a lack of consistent scientific data to facilitate informed decision-making that may lead to significant health improvements in the SCD community. A population-based surveillance system will allow for the identification of individuals with SCD and the standardized collection of information about their clinical history. Since 2015, CDC has managed the Sickle Cell Data Collection (SCDC) program, a state wide, population-based surveillance system, in two states (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemoglobinopathies/scdc.html). SCDC allows these states to analyze the health information of individuals with SCD and identify crucial gaps in their diagnosis, treatment, and access to care. The results of these analyses inform stakeholders about how these gaps can be filled through policy changes, improved health care practices, and new treatments. SCDC data have played a role in the opening of new SCD clinics, the educations of health care providers, state policies related to health care for SCD, and the enhancement of federally-funded activities across HHS. Through this NOFO, CDC plans to fund up to five recipients for a three-year period of performance to participate in the implementation of a state-wide SCD surveillance system. NOFO activities will include 1) surveillance team engagement, data collection, and annual reporting of aggregate level data (Core Component) and 2) analysis of SCD surveillance data and dissemination of results (Supplemental Component). Applicants must apply for the Core Component. Additionally, applicants can choose to apply for the Supplemental Component via a single application. This NOFO will improve and expand the current SCDC efforts by increasing the number of states to implement the program. Each state has a unique demographic makeup, distinct health care policies, and challenges related to access to care; all of these factors play a large role in the outcomes and experiences of individuals with SCD. This NOFO will enhance understanding of the incidence, prevalence, demographics, health care utilization patterns, and mortality of SCD in the United States."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"Strengthening Global Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) Network","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322659","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>CDC-RFA-GH20-2108</b>","contentSnippet":"CDC-RFA-GH20-2108","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322659","categories":["HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"opportunity-id":"322659"},{"opportunity-number":"CDC-RFA-GH20-2108"},{"opportunity-title":"Strengthening Global Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) Network"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Health"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.318"},{"eligible-applicants":"Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":""},{"agency-code":"HHS-CDC-CGH"},{"agency-name":"Department of Health and Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control - CGH"},{"posted-date":"Nov 21, 2019"},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 17, 2020"},{"estimated-synopsis-post-date":"Jan 31, 2020"},{"fiscal-year":"2020"},{"award-ceiling":"$0"},{"award-floor":"$0"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":"$500,000,000"},{"expected-number-of-awards":"6"},{"description":"Globally there is insufficient capacity to adequately prevent, detect and respond to public health issues.

To support DDT development efforts, FDA established qualification programs for animal models for use under the Animal Rule, biomarkers, and clinical outcome assessments. Examples of DDTs may include but are not limited to: a biomarker used for clinical trial enrichment, a clinical outcome assessment (COA) used to evaluate clinical benefit, or an animal model used for efficacy testing of medical countermeasures under the regulations commonly referred to as the Animal Rule. Qualification is a conclusion that within the stated context of use, the DDT can be relied upon to have a specific interpretation and application in drug development and regulatory review under the FD&C Act. Qualification does not encompass the use of a DDT outside the Context of Use (COU) specified through the qualification process. Once qualified, a DDT may be used within the qualified COU as part of any relevant drug or biologic Investigational New Drug Application (IND), New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic Licensing Application (BLA) without submission of additional information to justify the use of the DDT. Qualification of a DDT is voluntary, and the use of a qualified DDT is not required for drug or biologic development. However, having qualified DDTs that can be used by multiple sponsors helps optimize drug development and evaluation. Increased public availability of qualified DDTs for specific contexts of use is anticipated to benefit the public health through (1) increased availability of effective drugs, (2) earlier access to medical therapies and (3) an enhanced knowledge of the drug under development. The qualification process allows for greater efficiency of development of DDTs by promoting DDT development in the precompetitive arena through collaborative efforts such as public-private partnerships and consortia. These grants will be used to provide funding to developers of drug development tools that have an accepted Letter of Intent (LOI) within CDER/CBER's Drug Development Tool Qualification Program and are working towards to next qualification submission as described here: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DrugDevelopmentToolsQualificationProgram/ucm378219.htm. The grants will be used to further the development of tools that, once qualified, will be made publicly available to fill unmet needs in drug development. Applicants should use the outline of the Qualification Plan (QP) or Full Qualification Package (FQP) of the respective DDT program they are in, to assist in developing their grant application. Funding will only support grantee's work towards either their qualification plan or full qualification package."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"KUH Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Fellow Transition Award (F99/K00)","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323717","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>RFA-DK-19-032</b>","contentSnippet":"RFA-DK-19-032","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323717","categories":["FN|Food and Nutrition","HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323717"},{"opportunity-number":"RFA-DK-19-032"},{"opportunity-title":"KUH Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Fellow Transition Award (F99/K00)"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Food and NutritionHealth"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.847"},{"eligible-applicants":"Public and State controlled institutions of higher educationNonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationFor profit organizations other than small businessesSmall businessesOthers (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Other Eligible Applicants include the following:  Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISISs); Eligible Agencies of the Federal Government; Hispanic-serving Institutions; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) ; Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are not eligible to apply.

The BLM manages habitat for over 430 wildlife, fish, and plant species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and at least 15 species identified as candidates for listing. In many cases, BLM managed public lands offer the best hope for recovery of rare or listed plant and animal species and many occur only on BLM managed lands.BLM Utah has an opportunity to work with partner organizations to assist with the conservation of various species, to include federally listed, candidate and Bureau sensitive species. Conservation includes, but is not limited to, gaining knowledge about species and their habitats, providing for protection or management of species and their habitats, augmenting species, restoring, and enhancing rare species habitat. This program is in support of creating a conservation stewardship legacy second to only Teddy Roosevelt by providing an opportunity to strengthen state and local partnerships, implement priority species and habitat monitoring, support restoration activities that enhance habitat connectivity and resiliency, and enhances opportunities for volunteer service and youth engagement on public lands.All awards under this funding opportunity must benefit the general public. The public will benefit from these partnerships because we are fostering conservation, restoration, and ecosystem services. Improvement of biological communities of at-risk species may prevent federal listing under the Endangered Species Act and supports the public interest by protecting federally listed species, a federal trust resource.

This program will enhance women and girls’ leadership skills in diverse communities. Through pairing participants from different backgrounds and communities in a mutually beneficial relationship, USAID/Egypt seeks to support emerging leaders to identify and mediate the underlying causes of disputes within their communities. The program will also focus on building the self-esteem, leadership, and consensus-building skills of participants and the broader community.The Inter-Community Activity will promote cooperation between girls from different communities, including those with diverse traditional values. The program will support the ability of young participants to continue their education, increase confidence and expand influence within their communities. The development hypothesis of the proposed activity posits that if girls in communities can engage in cross-cultural and inter-community dialogue to develop a common vision, then consensus can be built to promote a stronger community that empowers both women and girls and provides them with equal opportunities that will lead to inclusive economic growth. To this end, the proposed program will provide a safe and secure venue for continuing education and discussion on vital issues for young women and girls that promote opportunities and inclusion. Concurrently, the activity will engage individuals from different communities and demographic groups to participate in exercises to identify, prioritize, and address community needs through community initiatives, participation in cultural events, or the establishment of joint micro-enterprises when and where specific opportunities are identified.["},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"20.PMWRA.Angola.HumanitarianMineAction.NOFO","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323725","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>SFOP0006363</b>","contentSnippet":"SFOP0006363","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323725","categories":["O|Other (see text field entitled \"Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity\" for clarification)"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323725"},{"opportunity-number":"SFOP0006363"},{"opportunity-title":"20.PMWRA.Angola.HumanitarianMineAction.NOFO"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Other (see text field entitled \"Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity\" for clarification)"},{"category-explanation":"Conventional Weapons Destruction (CWD)"},{"cfda-numbers":"19.800"},{"eligible-applicants":"Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher education"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Domestic NGOs and Foreign NGOs"},{"agency-code":"DOS-PMWRA"},{"agency-name":"Department of StatePM Weapons Removal and Abatement"},{"posted-date":"Jan 16, 2020"},{"close-date":"Mar 31, 2020"},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 16, 2020"},{"award-ceiling":"$2,100,000"},{"award-floor":"$0"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":"$2,100,000"},{"expected-number-of-awards":"1"},{"description":"The U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement (PM/WRA) is pleased to invite eligible organizations to submit applications for a grant to conduct humanitarian demining programs in Angola during fiscal year 2020.

Brief Description of Anticipated Work:This project focuses on the following objectives: 1)   MGT, INVASIVE SPECIES, MULITPLE The purpose of this task is for the NFE to conduct required Invasive Weed Surveys and Eradication on Nellis AFB and the NTTR. This work will concentrate first on invasive populations close to both the main base and range boundaries. The goal is to prevent invasive plants from moving throughout Air Force property. While this work is ongoing an invasive plant inventory of areas on Nellis AFB and the NTTR will continue. The survey will concentrate on areas most likely to contain invasive plants based on review of maps, photographic imagery and ground surveys.  Based on the survey results efforts will continue to concentrate on the largest populations or areas where the potential for population expansion is high. Re-vegetation efforts will begin and continue if required and as soon as practical based on the type of treatment used. Re- seeding disturbed areas where invasive plants would pose additional wildland fire risk will be the primary focus of the re-vegetation efforts. All planted species will be native and drought tolerant. When possible the plants will help prevent erosion and be suitable for wildlife.   2)   MGT, SPECIES, MULTIPLE a) REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  The overall purpose of this project is to continue to document reptile and amphibian populations and seasonal habitat use on the Nellis AFB, Creech AFB, and NTTR and provide best management practices to sustain military air training operations and readiness.

These data will be used to evaluate long term trends with respect to environmental and visitation-related variables; and 2) demographic (e.g., survival) and abundance estimates, detailing change over time, for three populations of boreal toads (Anaxyrus boreas) in ROMO. USGS has detailed and continuous annual capture-mark-recapture data for these populations in the park over the same 32-year time frame. These data will be analyzed with respect to environmental covariates identified as important in earlier work (e.g., water quality, Battaglin et al. 2018) and the presence of the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochtrium dendrobatidis, Bd). This project will build on earlier park-wide occupancy surveys (Corn et al. 1997) to give ROMO a long-term picture of amphibian presence in the park and of persistence in boreal toads despite the challenge of disease. This information will have broader application as an example of how to survey and analyze amphibian data in National Parks and provide insights into what is necessary over the long-term to generate data that are relevant to management decisions. Insights generated from this effort will assist ROMO in developing management strategies to encourage persistence of amphibians in the park and more specifically in developing actions to bolster boreal toad persistence (e.g., preserving habitat characteristics where amphibians still occur)."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit, Rocky Mountain CESU","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323779","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>G20AS00032</b>","contentSnippet":"G20AS00032","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323779","categories":["ST|Science and Technology and other Research and Development"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323779"},{"opportunity-number":"G20AS00032"},{"opportunity-title":"Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit, Rocky Mountain CESU"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Science and Technology and other Research and Development"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"15.808"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"This financial assistance opportunity is being issued under a   Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit (CESU) Program.

A successful proposal should seek to institutionalize the program so it can be replicated within the official curriculum and supported by local institutions.   PROJECT GOALS  The goal of this project is to improve students’ understanding and trust in the justice system of Bosnia and Herzegovina through an experiential learning process. This experience should help students understand their rights within the justice system, strengthening their confidence from an early age in governing institutions and the rule of law. Empowered by an improved understanding of the justice system, students can take a more active role in civic life and help transform Bosnia and Herzegovina into a modern European democracy.

Non-profit national Associations/Organizations that represent human and/or animal food testing laboratories have the membership, resources, structure, and expertise necessary to build national consensus amongst state and local agencies on key human and animal food safety and laboratory issues. The intended outcome of this FOA is to advance the goal of a national food safety system by supporting and enhancing state human and animal food testing laboratories tasked with surveillance and emergency response testing, including investigations of foodborne disease outbreaks. The resulting cooperative agreement will provide the additional support to these laboratories through the activities of an association that will conduct research on national testing capability and capacity; develop best practices and other guidance manuals; offer trainings, workshops, meetings, and other educational resources; support ISO/IEC 17025 laboratory accreditation for non-accredited laboratories; and other activities to support human and animal food testing laboratories.  Program Goals: State and local laboratories play a critical role in the identification, containment, and prevention of foodborne illness. FDA is committed to assisting these laboratories in building laboratory capacity and capability, maintaining and expanding the scope of ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation, and supporting the groundbreaking work achieved through the GenomeTrakr network. Effective leveraging of resources and harmonization of efforts will require extensive collaboration with relevant initiatives, including those of federal partners, national initiatives, associations/organizations, and State and local partners. The intended outcome of this FOA is to assist laboratories with building laboratory capacity and capability, in addition to assisting FDA in the development of trainings, workshops, educational materials, and meetings in support of LFFM and unfunded laboratories conducting testing of human and animal food samples.  This cooperative agreement is only available to non-profit, national associations/organizations that represent state and local laboratories that conduct food and/or animal feed testing on behalf of state and local regulatory programs. Project Objectives (progress assessed semi-annually): 1. Research into the development and implementation of trainings, workshops, and other educational materials and resources for use by laboratories in the LFFM, in addition to unfunded laboratories seeking to achieve, maintain, and enhance ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation. Areas in need include effective workshops and seminars on laboratory procedures, data transfer (to NCBI and FDA data systems), document control, quality management systems, continuous improvement, sample collection, and risk assessment.   Methods of delivery for training could include: webinars, teleconferences, workshops, on-site   technical sessions, face-to-face meetings, or information sharing through web-based resources.  Both individual laboratory and broad-based training needs should be considered and met by the grantee. Training programs developed shall be pre-reviewed and approved by FDA prior to delivery. FDA will periodically assess the trainer’s performance by reviewing the course assessments and evaluations completed by students (individual and aggregated data). 2. Plan and host annual meetings, including scheduling, agenda planning, invitations, on-site logistics (meeting facilities and AV needs and support), registration, materials, and follow-up evaluations, for: a. The LFFM Face-to-Face Meeting, including breakout sessions for the various LFFM disciplines b. The GenomeTrakr face-to-face meeting. Meeting agendas and materials shall be pre-reviewed and approved by FDA prior to distribution and execution. 3. Provide direct technical assistance to non-FDA funded state human and animal food testing laboratories seeking ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation. 4. Research, develop, and maintain a crosswalk of state and FDA regulations and standards regarding human and animal food-related illness and outbreak response. This crosswalk must include sample collection requirements, analytical methodology, and compliance standards and action levels, among other areas agreed upon with FDA. The association may need to utilize surveys or other means of communication with the state laboratories to develop this crosswalk. This crosswalk also must be made available to FDA in a format agreed upon by FDA.  5. Evaluate data collected from the crosswalk and identify areas of improvement that can be developed into best practices and utilized for training and other resources.  6. Assist states with National Food Safety Data Exchange (NFSDX) implementation, specifically with sample data exchange. 7. Promote Office of Regulatory Affairs Partners Portal (ORAPP), Laboratory Business Services (LBS), and NFSDX at conferences, including providing outreach and recruiting laboratories. This outreach should emphasize how ORAPP, LBS, and NFSDX allows partner organizations to send information to and receive information from the FDA, and other state agencies electronically, and demonstrate how that would be of benefit to such non-federal entities. 8. Integrate FDA-provided NFSDX training modules into existing training programs offered by the association, as appropriate. 9. Collaborate with the Partnership for Food Protection IT Working Group (PFP IT WG) to assist in data system transition activities. 10. Research, develop, and distribute best practices documents, protocols, and standard operating procedures for GenomeTrakr, in collaboration with FDA. 11. Evaluate activities across GenomeTrakr and PulseNet networks and provide a written report identifying the commonalities, differences, and areas of opportunity for collaboration. 12. Provide travel assistanceto laboratorians of non-FDA funded organizations for:  GenomeTrakr-contributing laboratorians to trainings, meetings and conference LFFM annual meeting FDA's Office of Training Education and Development (OTED) trainings InFORM meeting Other meetings, training courses, and educational opportunities, as determined by FDA, that are intended for federal, state and local public health and laboratory scientists.  13. Collaborate with Partnership for Food Protection Laboratory Working Group (PFP Lab WG) to support national laboratory initiatives, such as identifying best practices for data sharing and acceptability."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"2020 Preservation Technology and Training Grants","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323812","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>P20AS00028</b>","contentSnippet":"P20AS00028","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323812","categories":["NR|Natural Resources"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323812"},{"opportunity-number":"P20AS00028"},{"opportunity-title":"2020 Preservation Technology and Training Grants"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Natural Resources"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"15.923"},{"eligible-applicants":"Public and State controlled institutions of higher educationNonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationOthers (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"In accordance with 54 U.S.C.305304c.

This FOA requires that the intervention under study be embedded into health care delivery system, real world settings. Studies can propose to integrate interventions that have demonstrated efficacy into health care system; or implement health care system changes to improve adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Trials must be conducted across two or more health care systems (HCS) and must be conducted as part of the NIH HCS Research Collaboratory supported through the NIH Common Fund.

The program was funded by the Departmentof State under the Freedom Support Act. Program activities in this area ended in 2018. Over theyears the program has evolved to include agricultural scientists from Eastern Europe and theFormer Soviet Union. Today the program focuses on improving veterinary education andresearch in selected African nations for early to mid-career instructors at Colleges of VeterinaryMedicine in Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. Training programs are designed andorganized in conjunction with U.S. universities, USDA, and other government agencies. FEPemphasizes improved and updated course and curriculum development, teaching and studentassessment methods, exposure to current research techniques and practical field experienceswhile studying in the United States. FEP includes follow-up visits by U.S. host professors to theparticipants' universities to assess progress in implementation of courses developed andencourage collaboration between U.S. and participating universities. Since 2016, the programhas hosted 54 veterinary faculty participants from Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, andUganda.ObjectivesThe purpose of the Faculty Exchange Program is to assist developing countries to improve theiruniversity agricultural education, research, and extension programs by providing a one semestertraining program at U.S. Land Grant Agricultural Universities. Participants are able to upgradetheir technical knowledge in their subject area, but they also learn new teaching methods throughclass observation, and they will learn new research methods though experience in the lab orthrough short courses or one-on-one instruction. Each participant revises and modernizes theirclass outlines for introduction at their home university after they return. Participants also travelto laboratories, farms agribusinesses, and government offices to gain an understanding of howthe veterinary science and animal health systems operate in the United States. Faculty mentorsvisit each participant in their home country 3-9 months after the conclusion of the U.S. basedprogram to provide follow-on support and advice.USDA will select Fellows based on similar backgrounds in research areas and place them in groups of ten Fellows.

Purpose of Program: The major purposes of the CSP are to expand opportunities for all students, particularly traditionally underserved students, to attend public charter schools[1] and meet challenging State academic standards; provide financial assistance for the planning, program design, and initial implementation of charter schools; increase the number of high-quality charter schools available to students across the United States; evaluate the impact of charter schools on student achievement, families, and communities; share best practices between charter schools and other public schools; encourage States to provide facilities support to charter schools; and support efforts to strengthen the charter school authorizing process.   Through the CSP Grants to State Entities (CSP State Entities) competition (CFDA number 84.282A), the Department awards grants to State entities that, in turn, award subgrants to eligible applicants for the purpose of opening new charter schools and replicating and expanding high-quality charter schools. Grant funds may also be used to provide technical assistance to eligible applicants and authorized public chartering agencies in opening new charter schools and replicating and expanding high-quality charter schools; and to work with authorized public chartering agencies in the State to improve authorizing quality, including developing capacity for, and conducting, fiscal oversight and auditing of charter schools. Background: The CSP State Entities program provides financial assistance to State entities to support charter schools that serve elementary and secondary school students in a given State. Charter schools receiving funds under the CSP State Entities program also may serve students in early childhood education programs or postsecondary students.    The CSP State Entities program is authorized under Title IV, Part C of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESEA) (20 U.S.C. 7221-7221j).

The UH3 is to provide funding for 3 years to a project that successfully completed the milestones set in the UG3. UG3 projects that have met their milestones will be administratively considered by NIDA and prioritized for transition to the UH3 phase. Investigators responding to this FOA must address both UG3 and UH3 phases. Application may include preclinical or clinical research studies that will have high impact and quickly yield the necessary results to advance closer to FDA approval medications that are safe and effective to prevent and treat OUDs and overdose. The compounds to be evaluated can be small molecules or biologics. They can be tested in pre-clinical models and/or for the clinical manifestations of OUDs such as withdrawal, craving, relapse, or overdose. Applications may focus on the development of new chemical entities, new formulations of marketed medications available for other indications, or combinations of medications that hold promise for the treatment of OUDs and overdose. Through this FOA, NIDA seeks to fast-track the discovery and development of medications to prevent and treat OUDs or opioid overdose and to advance them in the FDA's drug development approval pipeline. This project is part of the NIH initiative to establish a public-private partnership to address the opioid crisis via more effective and safe ways to prevent and treat opioid use disorders and overdose. https://www.nih.gov/opioid-crisis"},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"FY2020 Research Opportunities in Accelerator Stewardship","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323865","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>DE-FOA-0002262</b>","contentSnippet":"DE-FOA-0002262","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323865","categories":["ST|Science and Technology and other Research and Development"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323865"},{"opportunity-number":"DE-FOA-0002262"},{"opportunity-title":"FY2020 Research Opportunities in Accelerator Stewardship"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Science and Technology and other Research and Development"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"81.049"},{"eligible-applicants":"Public housing authorities/Indian housing authoritiesPrivate institutions of higher educationOthers (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Eligibility is limited by the \"Track\" under this FOA to which an application is submitted:  Under Track 1, eligibility is limited to all domestic applicants except for DOE National Laboratories.

To qualify as an eligible institution under the AANAPISI Program, an institution must--      (i)  Be accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association that the Secretary has determined to be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered;      (ii)  Be legally authorized by the State in which it is located to be a junior or community college or to provide an educational program for which it awards a bachelor's degree; and     (iii)  Be designated as an “eligible institution,” as defined in 34 CFR 600.2, by demonstrating that it: (1)  has an enrollment of needy students as described in 34 CFR 607.3; and (2)  has low average educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent (FTE) undergraduate student as described in 34 CFR 607.4.       Note:  The notice announcing the FY 2020 process for designation of eligible institutions, and inviting applications for waiver of eligibility requirements, was published in the Federal Register on December 16, 2019 (84 FR 68434).  Only institutions that the Department determines are eligible, or which are granted a waiver under the process described in that notice, may apply for a grant in this program.     b.  Relationship between the Title III, Part A Programs and the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program:     A grantee under the HSI Program, which is authorized under title V of the HEA, may not receive a grant under any HEA, title III, part A program.  The title III, part A programs are:  the Strengthening Institutions Program; the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Program; the Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions Program; the Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions Program; and the Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions Program.        Furthermore, a current HSI Program grantee may not give up its HSI Program grant in order to be eligible to receive a grant under the AANAPISI Program or any title III, part A program as described in 34 CFR 607.2(g)(1).     An eligible HSI that is not a current grantee under the HSI Program may apply for a FY 2020 grant under all title III, part A programs for which it is eligible, as well as receive consideration for a grant under the HSI Program.  However, a successful applicant may receive only one grant as described in 34 CFR 607.2(g)(1).         An eligible IHE that submits applications for an Individual Development Grant and a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant in this competition may be awarded both in the same fiscal year.  However, we will not award a second Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant to an otherwise eligible IHE for an award year for which the IHE already has a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant award under the AANAPISI Program.  A grantee with an Individual Development Grant or a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant may be a subgrantee in one or more Cooperative Arrangement Development Grants.  The lead institution in a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant must be an eligible institution.  Partners or subgrantees are not required to be eligible institutions."},{"agency-code":"ED"},{"agency-name":"Department of Education"},{"posted-date":"Jan 28, 2020"},{"close-date":"Feb 27, 2020 Applications Available: January 28, 2020.

In Uganda, key populations (KP) including, female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), transgender, and prison populations, collectively contribute to more than 7% of the new HIV infections.

Specific Phase I and II milestones, which will be formalized pre-award and serve as a schedule of performance expectations to maximize the output from each phase of the study. Milestone performance will be a major factor in determining which applications will be selected to transition from Phase I to Phase II. Phase II extends up to addressing preclinical functional outcomes, toxicology, and pharmacokinetics needed to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Multi-disciplinary, multiple PI teams combining expertise in respiratory neurobiology, opioid pharmacology and pre-clinical drug development are strongly encouraged. This FOA is intended for pharmacotherapeutic development. Projects proposing device and model development or validation, the elucidation of biological mechanisms, population-based epidemiology, or human subjects research would not be responsive.

Such systems bring together Federal, state and local resources and funding streams to help support, expand and streamline the delivery of planned and emergency respite services, provider recruitment and training, caregiver training and empowerment, and delivery of gap-filling respite services. Target populations for this program are family caregivers of individuals with chronic or long-term needs across the age and disability spectrum. Grantees will be expected to use funds to plan, establish and expand/enhance Lifespan Respite Care systems in their states, including new and planned emergency respite services, training and recruiting respite workers and volunteers and assisting caregivers with gaining access to needed services.

Please carefully follow all instructions below.  Project Objectives: This project advances the U.S. interest in making Panamanian institutions more resilient, transparent, and democratic through the promotion of media literacy as a preventative measure against misinformation. Through educational methods and materials that promote media literacy and associated critical thinking skills, citizens will be better able to evaluate and hold to account not only the media but also other sources of information.   Project Description: This project will deliver a series of trainings for educators—focusing primarily on those who teach English through the Panama Bilingue program—to integrate media literacy and critical thinking into their existing curricula at all educational levels. The approach and materials will be modeled on Ithaca College’s Project Look Sharp or an equivalent program.  The trainings will be conducted in person with interactive exercises and include both materials and strategies not only to teach the educators about media literacy, but also to empower them to convey that knowledge to their students. Trainings should be tailored to groups of educators at different educational levels (e.g. primary, secondary, university). Course materials may include existing kits and lesson plans, but should include additional material localized to Panama. The proposal should include a method for follow-up evaluation and qualitative measurement of results for both the educators and their students.  Grant funding should be used for any and all expenses for the program, including but not limited to personnel, course materials, venue costs, and the transportation of participants.  Partners and Audience: The ideal implementer of this project will have knowledge of Panama’s educational sector and methods for countering misinformation in the public sphere and have the capacity to convey this knowledge through training. Additional familiarity with the political, media, and business environment in Panama is a plus.  The audience will be teachers and professors of English or the social sciences, with particular focus on those who teach English through the Panama Bilingue program.

most of our planet's biodiversity remains unknown. The scale of Earth's unknown diversity is especially troubling given the rapid and permanent loss of biodiversity across the globe. The goal of the Dimensions of Biodiversity campaign is to transform how we describe and understand the scope and role of life on Earth. This campaign promotes novel integrative approaches to fill the most substantial gaps in our understanding of the diversity of life on Earth. It takes a broad view of biodiversity, and focuses on the intersection of genetic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions of biodiversity. Successful proposals must integrate these three dimensions to understand interactions among them. While this focus complements several core programs in the Biological Sciences Directorate at NSF, it differs by requiring that multiple dimensions of biodiversity be addressed simultaneously, in novel ways, to understand their synergistic roles in critical ecological and evolutionary processes, especially pertaining to the mechanisms driving the origin, maintenance, and functional roles of biodiversity. The 2020 Dimensions of Biodiversity program is restricted to projects supported by international partnerships with the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) of Brazil, and the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa. Proposals are to be submitted jointly, with the US PIs submitting to NSF and the collaborating Chinese, Brazilian, or South African PIs submitting to their appropriate national funding agencies.

The intended outcome of the FOA is to advance efforts for a nationally integrated food safety system through the conformance with an advancement of the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (VNRFRPS or Retail Program Standards). The VNRFRPS apply to the operation and management of a retail food regulatory program that is focused on the reduction of risk factors known to contribute to foodborne illness and the promotion of industry action to achieve active managerial control of these risk factors. The Retail Program Standards include nine individual Program Standards. Each Program Standard has one or more corresponding worksheets, forms and guidance documents. While the Retail Program Standards represent a model of the effective, focused food safety program, they begin by providing a foundation and system upon which all regulatory programs can build through a continuous improvement process. The Retail Program Standards encourage regulatory agencies to improve and build upon existing programs. Further, the Retail Program Standards provide a framework designed to accommodate both traditional and emerging approaches to food safety. The Retail Program Standards are intended to reinforce proper sanitation (good retail practices) and operational and environmental prerequisite programs while encouraging regulatory agencies and industry to focus on the factors that cause and contribute to foodborne illness, with the ultimate goal or reducing the occurrence of those factors.  BACKGROUND This funding opportunity furthers FDA's support of state, local, territorial, and tribal retail food safety programs. The purpose of this support system will be to assist these agencies in advancing efforts for a nationally integrated food safety system through research, planning, establishment, and/or enhancement of state and territorial retail food regulatory programs. Recent legislative and strategic initiatives have addressed FDA's relationship with state, local, territorial and tribal authorities in retail food protection activities. Please visit http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/default.htm for more information. a. Retail Food Safety Initiative Announced in October 2010, the Retail Food Safety Initiative is part of the Food and Drug Administration’s overall prevention-based, farm-to-table food safety strategy to reduce foodborne illness. The FDA actions in this initiative are prompted by a 10-year study of more than 800 retail food establishments to determine compliance with five key risk factors in nine types of retail operations. FDA's partnerships with the retail food industry; state, local, territories and tribal authorities; and other government agencies are a foundational building block of the initiative and key to its success in four action areas:  Make the presence of certified food protection managers common practice. Strengthen active managerial controls at the retail level and ensure better compliance. Encourage widespread, uniform, and complete adoption of the FDA Food Code. Create an enhanced local regulatory environment for retail food operations.  To help create an enhanced local regulatory environment for retail food operations, FDA is committed to: (1) Promoting wider implementation by state, local and tribal regulatory programs of the FDA Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Programs Standards; (2) Ensuring universal participation by local regulators in consistent, high-quality training through increased access and increased portability and transferability of FDA courses; and (3) Seeking increased multi-year funding for the state, local and tribal programs as part of an integrated food safety system. b. Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) Under section 1004 of FDAAA (21 U.S.C. 2104), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (which includes FDA) is required to work with the states to improve food safety. Section 1004(a) of FDAAA (21 U.S.C. 2104(a)) states that the Secretary shall provide assistance to encourage states to: (1) Establish, continue, or strengthen state food safety programs, especially with respect to the regulation of retail commercial food establishments; and (2) Establish procedures and requirements for ensuring that processed produce under the jurisdiction of state food safety programs is not unsafe for human consumption. This assistance to plan, develop, and implement such a food safety program may include: (1) Advisory assistance; (2) Technical assistance, training, and laboratory assistance; and (3) Financial and other assistance (21 U.S.C. 2104(b)). c. FDA Food Safety Modernization Act The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), signed into law on January 4, 2011, provides FDA with tools to better protect public health by strengthening the food safety system. It enables FDA to focus on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur. It also provides FDA with new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention- and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur. These include authorities such as mandatory recall, expanded administrative detention, and suspension of facility registration. FSMA also gives FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods. FSMA directs FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities, explicitly recognizing that all food safety agencies need to work together in an integrated way to achieve national public health goals. FSMA identifies some key priorities in working with partners in areas such as: reliance on federal, state, and local agencies for inspections; improving foodborne illness surveillance; and leveraging and enhancing state and local food safety and defense capacities. OBJECTIVES When first enrolling in the Retail Program Standards, retail regulatory programs are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive self-assessment to identify program needs and then establish priorities to maximize the effectiveness of resources. Post self-assessment, cooperative agreement funds shall be used to enhance or establish systems to: a. Address gaps identified through the self-assessment process to achieve greater conformance with the Retail Program Standards; b. Complete a risk factor study (or track routine inspection data) to identify the foodborne illness risk factors most in need of priority attention; and/or c. Implement intervention strategies to reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors (Intervention strategies are defined as a comprehensive set of activities, initiatives, or specific tools implemented on the part of industry and/or regulators that are designed to bring about immediate and/or long-term control of foodborne illness risk factors). The cooperative agreements that will be funded through this FOA are intended to develop, implement, and continuously improve the infrastructure and effectiveness of retail food programs using the VNRFRPS. Under the resulting cooperative agreements, state, local, territorial, or tribal jurisdictions will implement a continuous program improvement/enhancement strategy (action plan) using the VNRFRPS. The action plan will identify activities, timeframes, personnel and other resources required for implementation of the improvement/enhancement strategy. Funds may be utilized for a variety of activities and those allowable expenses are listed in Section IV. OUTCOMES The intended outcomes of the work provided under the resulting cooperative agreements are as follows: 1. Retail food regulatory programs demonstrate increased conformance by meeting part or all of standards criteria within the Retail Program Standards; 2. Retail food regulatory programs complete a risk factor study (or track routine inspection data) to identify the foodborne illness risk factors most in need of priority attention; 3. Retail food regulatory programs develop and implement intervention strategies to reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors in need of priority attention; 4. Retail food regulatory programs develop and implement training programs to ensure staff is adequately trained, able to train others, and/or standardized, in conformance with the Retail Program Standards; 5. Retail food regulatory programs develop and implement an action plan that justifies the need for resources including, but not limited to, equipment, personnel, or software to address gaps identified in the Program Standards self-assessment; and/or 6. Retail food regulatory programs leverage other jurisdictions and/or organizations to assist in achieving conformance with one or more standards, conduct risk factor studies (or track routine inspection data), develop and implement intervention strategies, develop/deliver training programs, or otherwise build capacity to more effectively prevent foodborne illness and/or more effectively and efficiently respond to foodborne illness outbreaks, should they occur. Only state, local, territorial, and tribal agencies with primary regulatory responsibilities for retail food establishments, or those government agencies with substantial involvement and control over such agencies are eligible to apply. In addition, the retail food regulatory agency must be enrolled in the VNRFRPS and have completed a current self-assessment against all nine (9) Retail Program Standards.  Upon submission of the completed enrollment form, FDA will add the jurisdiction to its on-line Listing of Jurisdictions Enrolled in the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards. The on-line listing will be reviewed to confirm registration. PERFORMANCE MEASURES Consistent with an increased focus on performance accountability as required by the Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200, an emphasis will be placed on the applicant’s ability to measure progress and track its performance using objective, proven, and measurable data. As such, applicants should carefully consider the Scored Review Criteria listed in Section V of this announcement when submitting their application. Each applicant is encouraged to identify performance measures, baseline data, and targets for activities listed in the objectives and outcomes sections of this announcement as appropriate and feasible."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"Notice of Intent: ANSS products and dissemination for Alaska","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322911","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>USGS-FA-20-0032</b>","contentSnippet":"USGS-FA-20-0032","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322911","categories":["O|Other (see text field entitled \"Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity\" for clarification)"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"322911"},{"opportunity-number":"USGS-FA-20-0032"},{"opportunity-title":"Notice of Intent: ANSS products and dissemination for Alaska"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Other (see text field entitled \"Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity\" for clarification)"},{"category-explanation":"Natural Hazards"},{"cfda-numbers":"15.807"},{"eligible-applicants":"Public and State controlled institutions of higher education"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":""},{"agency-code":"DOI-USGS1"},{"agency-name":"Department of the InteriorU.

All SOIs must be advertised via www.Grants.gov, responses requested by 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST), on 27 February 2020.   Responses to this Request for Statements of Interest will be used to identify potential investigators for a project to be funded by Fort Polk which provides professional and technical support for its Range Management Program in order to facilitate successful implementation of the encroachments on military readiness training lands managed by Fort Polk. Approximately $250,000 is expected to be available to support this project in the base year. Additional funding may be available for follow on work in subsequent fiscal years to the successful Recipient/Awardee.   Type of Award:  In accordance with section 6305 – Using cooperative agreements of the Federal Grant and  Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977 (31 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq.), all projects must carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation, instead of acquiring goods or services for the exclusive direct benefit of the United States Government.  In accordance with section 6305 – Using cooperative agreements of the Federal Grant and  Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977 (31 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq.), substantial involvement is expected between the federal partner and the nonfederal partner when carrying out the activities specified in the project agreement. The exact nature of the government’s involvement will be defined in the statement of objectives, issued with a request for full proposal.   As a result, it is anticipated that a cooperative agreement will be awarded.   Brief Description of Anticipated Work:   This research focuses on the following objectives:  1) Objective 1: Capture: To contain at large livestock in an enclosure that reasonably assures detention of the animals.  Limitations on number of animals captured: {on Fort Polk and under the Environmental Assessment – the number of animals captured at any given time is within a loose definition of one to three bands. The EA specifically states “This COA would start with the capture of lots of horses consisting of one to three bands (10-30 horses). The intent of capturing small groups of horses over an extended period of time is to permit the various participating organizations sufficient time to move the horses through their adoption programs rather than overwhelming those organizations with all of the horses in a one to three month period.” (§2.3.7)}.   Methods of capture: The method of capture is not specified, although the following commitment must be adhered to “Fort Polk intends to capture horses in the least stressful manner to the horses, provided that capture method is sufficiently efficient and successful. The preferred and intended primary method to be utilized for capture is the baiting of capture pens so that horses move into the capture pens without external pressure. The secondary method of capture which will likely be utilized is the employment of personnel to physically round up and capture the horses. Fort Polk will not use or permit the use of aircraft to drive the horses over a long distance in a swift manner for purposes of roundup and capture.” (§EA2.3)   Capture by Fort Polk Personnel: FPLA reserves the right to opportunistically capture horses. In such cases, the co-opportunity partner still executes tasks 2-6 below   Government furnished materials: Fort Polk has available two capture/holding pens. These pens are constructed of cyclone fence to enclose a 2 acre area. The pens have two gate access points. Within this enclosure a ¼ acre lot is constructed. The fence for this lot is constructed of wood and is six feet tall. Besides on main gate the lot also has an exit that is a 30’ long chute (also constructed of wood and fully enclosed with a slat board top. At the end of this chute is a fabricated material squeeze chute. There are no wing or drift fences inside of the larger (2ac) or smaller (¼ ac) enclosures however heavy duty portable panels (as discussed below) can be used for these purposes.   Fort Polk has available sixty (60) heavy duty portable panels. These panels are 10’ by 6’ and are constructed with 1.5 – 2” tubing. These may be used within the above mentioned enclosures or otherwise for capture, but if used for capture a sufficient number should be held in reserve for flexibility when working captured animals    Access to Range Areas: Access to range areas is controlled by range control and adherence to daily check-in and check-out procedures is required. Range access will be limited or denied on certain days. Other suitable capture sites may be developed or current infrastructure may be used, coordination with Fort Polk Range Control is required on a case by case basis.    2) Objective 2: Unique Identification: If a 501(c) 3 organization cannot provide scanner, the co-operator conducts physical or electronic Inspection to determine if an animal has a unique identification of ownership. This includes scanning for microchips; inspection for brands; inspection for tattoos. The co-operator makes a good faith effort to determine if the horse is stolen, and if so, to locate the owner. To contain at large livestock in an enclosure that reasonably assures detention of the animals.    3) Objective 3: Blood Samples: To immobilize an animal sufficient for a veterinarian and assisting veterinarian technicians to draw blood samples to be used to test for various equine diseases. The Chutes and panels mentioned in Line Item 1 above are available, but there are no other government furnished materials for this line item.      4) Objective 4: Maintain Captive Horses: To provide sufficient feed and water to sustain and care for the animals while in the capture/holding pen(s) and until they are removed from the installation. Co-operator must be able to transport water.    5) Objective 5: Load: Load horses onto trailers (government, private, or 501C3) for transport of capture animals on or off of the installation.    6) Objective 6: Transportation: Must be able to transport horses to a different location (whether to a different pen on Post or off Post). Co-operator provides cost per mile for recoupment up to 30 miles and between 30 to 250 miles.

Without timely screening, diagnosis and intervention, children who are D/HH lose valuable time in gaining the skills that will put them on a trajectory to have language on par with their hearing peers in kindergarten and be ready to succeed in school. Additionally, among children who are D/HH, delays in language development are more difficult to remediate with late diagnosis and intervention. While collaborative efforts by CDC, states, and other partners have helped lead to the early identification of thousands of children who are D/HH each year, their developmental and language outcomes are often unknown and this data is not currently collected by CDC or State EHDI programs. Furthermore, it is currently unclear what actions beyond early identification should be taken by public health to help reduce morbidity and ensure children who are D/HH are ready for success in early childhood, including kindergarten. Therefore, without effective intervention that meets the needs of children and their families, the benefits of early identification on outcomes for these children are notably reduced. The current lack of public health capacity to document and assess the intervention services and associated outcomes of early identified children who are D/HH at the state and national level makes it challenging to: Ensure all children who are D/HH are ready for success in early childhood; Identify ways beyond early identification to help assess and reduce morbidity; Assess and document the success and impact of EHDI activities across the United States. As the first step toward minimizing significant language delays, the main goal of state EHDI programs is to ensure the hearing screening of all children before 1 month, recommend diagnostic services before 3 months of age for those not passing the hearing screening, and enrollment into early intervention if identified with a permanent hearing loss before 6 months of age. Although there has been a significant increase in the number of newborns receiving their hearing screen by one month of life and number of infants diagnosed as D/HH by 3 months of age, over 1,200 (about 20%) of infants annually do not receive or have documentation of having received intervention services. For children diagnosed as D/HH and enrolled into intervention services, it is often not possible for State EHDI programs to gather, analyze, and use early intervention and outcome related data. This is because information about services received (quantity/quality/specific type of intervention) and outcomes beyond enrollment in intervention services are not routinely available and/or shared with public health. These data are essential to strategic partners at all levels, and CDC in their surveillance efforts to assess and ensure optimal outcomes among children who are D/HH. Specifically, the availability of these data to public health can help to advance the practice of state EHDI programs, drive quality improvements, and help CDC-EHDI provide targeted technical assistance beyond screening and diagnosis to state programs. NCBDDD can take a leading role in this effort by providing states with the opportunity and tools needed to gather, analyze, and use standardized and relevant patient-level intervention and outcome data for infants diagnosed as D/HH. Previous projects have shown that it is possible for one center to facilitate the gathering, analyses, and use of outcome related data across multiple states. This included helping programs obtain relevant intervention data and use standard tools to help assess outcomes. Currently, many states are interested in intervention and outcomes related data but lack the capacity to routinely collect these data for children who are D/HH. To further assist states and children who are D/HH, CDC EHDI proposes to establish and support a developmental outcomes data center referred to as the Outcomes and Developmental Data Assistance Center (ODDACE). This center will focus on providing guidance and technical assistance to a select number of states around the gathering, analysis and practical application of intervention and outcome data. This is intended to help ensure all D/HH children are able to receive appropriate intervention services and reduce morbidity to support their success in early childhood. The center will serve as an extension of the CDC EHDI team and complement current initiatives to expand the capacity of states to collect and use patient-level data to help ensure the success of children who are D/HH. This proposed center will directly support CDC EHDI’s public health surveillance efforts to document interventions and outcomes and use these data to inform and promote practices to help ensure children are ready for success in early childhood by: Gathering intervention and outcome-related data in a standardized way to expand current EHDI public health surveillance activities; Analyzing intervention and outcome data across states to assess provision of intervention services and outcomes; Identify and document factors that impact the outcomes among children who are D/HH (e.g., frequency, type, and quality of intervention) Using data to inform decisions and practices, optimize interventions, and support improved health outcomes by reducing morbidity and help ensure children who are D/HH are ready to succeed in school and beyond. As part of these efforts ODDACE will work with participating states to foster and strengthen collaboration and engagement among strategic partners that support children who are D/HH and families. Specific activities Surveillance Capacity Identify data items and standardize definitions and measures related to outcomes and kindergarten/school readiness among children who are D/HH. Develop public health surveillance capacity to collect and use timely and standardized data on intervention, outcomes, and kindergarten/school readiness. Identify modifiable factors beyond meeting the 1-3-6 timeline that influence outcomes. Provide assistance to participating states in the analyses of data to determine kindergarten readiness and use of findings to inform policy decisions to help children that are not performing on par with their hearing peers. Develop innovative methods to facilitate the timely and efficient collection and reporting of intervention and outcome related to data. Inform and help educate providers and families across the EHDI continuum of care in assisting children who are D/HH and their families. Collaboration and Engagement Support the sharing and use of timely data among strategic partners at all levels, including CDC, state EHDI programs, county/local programs, families, intervention service providers, policy makers, and researchers. Demonstrate the benefits of sharing intervention and outcome related information with public health programs. Facilitate family engagement (as needed) to help obtain necessary consents in accordance with federal privacy laws to gather timely intervention related data on children who are D/HH. Promote and foster coordination and collaboration between participating local/county, state EHDI and early intervention programs related to public health surveillance for intervention and outcomes. Support the ongoing review and refinement of practices based on improved understandings about the relationship between intervention services and outcomes."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"Environmental Health Sciences Core Centers (EHSCC) (P30 Clinical Trial Optional)","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323951","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>RFA-ES-20-006</b>","contentSnippet":"RFA-ES-20-006","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323951","categories":["ENV|Environment","HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323951"},{"opportunity-number":"RFA-ES-20-006"},{"opportunity-title":"Environmental Health Sciences Core Centers (EHSCC) (P30 Clinical Trial Optional)"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"EnvironmentHealth"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.113"},{"eligible-applicants":"Public and State controlled institutions of higher educationNonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationFor profit organizations other than small businessesSmall businessesOthers (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Other Eligible Applicants include the following:  Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISISs); Hispanic-serving Institutions; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) ; Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are not eligible to apply.

Priority Region: Japan  Program Objectives:  A free and open Indo-Pacific is crucial for global stability in the 21st century. This vision for the Indo-Pacific is not unique to the United States, but is shared by Japan and many other nations in the region. However, there are many challenges to realizing this vision, including territorial and maritime disputes, differing economic approaches, historical concerns, and various types of governance. Therefore, multilateral cooperation is needed to address these challenges and ensure economic prosperity, good governance, and peace and security become a reality for all in the Indo-Pacific.   The Embassy welcomes proposals that address these issues and is particularly interested in supporting the following priority areas: maritime security, economic prosperity, civil society, disaster relief, health assistance, and rule of law.

Eligible Applicants:         This program is authorized by title III, part A, of the HEA.  At the time of submission of their applications, applicants must certify their total undergraduate headcount enrollment and that either 20 percent of the IHE’s enrollment is Alaska Native or 10 percent is Native Hawaiian.  An assurance form, which is included in the application materials for this competition, must be signed by an official for the applicant and submitted.         To qualify as an eligible institution under the ANNH Program, an institution must--        (i)  Be accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association that the Secretary has determined to be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered;  (ii)  Be legally authorized by the State in which it is located to be a junior or community college or to provide an educational program for which it awards a bachelor's degree;  (iii)  Be designated as an “eligible institution,” as defined in 34 CFR 600.2, by demonstrating that it: (1)  has an enrollment of needy students as described in 34 CFR 607.3; and (2)  has low average educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent (FTE) undergraduate student as described in 34 CFR 607.4.  Note:  The notice announcing the FY 2020 process for designation of eligible institutions, and inviting applications for waiver of eligibility requirements, was published in the Federal Register on December 16, 2019 (84 FR 68434).  Only institutions that the Department determines are eligible, or which are granted a waiver under the process described in that notice, may apply for a grant in this program.       b.  Relationship between the Title III, Part A Programs and the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program: A grantee under the HSI Program, which is authorized under title V of the HEA, may not receive a grant under any HEA, title III, part A program.  The title III, part A programs are:  the Strengthening Institutions Program; the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities program; the Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions program; the Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions program; and the Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions program.  Furthermore, a current HSI program grantee may not give up its HSI grant in order to be eligible to receive a grant under ANNH or any title III, part A program as described in 34 CFR 607.2(g)(1).       An eligible HSI that is not a current grantee under the HSI program may apply for a FY 2020 grant under all title III, part A programs for which it is eligible, as well as receive consideration for a grant under the HSI program.  However, a successful applicant may receive only one grant as described in 34 CFR 607.2(g)(1).           An eligible IHE that submits applications for an Individual Development Grant and a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant in this competition may be awarded both in the same fiscal year.  However, we will not award a second Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant to an otherwise eligible IHE for an award year for which the IHE already has a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant award under the ANNH Program.  A grantee with an Individual Development Grant or a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant may be a subgrantee in one or more Cooperative Arrangement Development Grants.

Eligible Applicants:         This program is authorized by title III, part A, of the HEA.  At the time of submission of their applications, applicants must certify their total undergraduate headcount enrollment and that either 20 percent of the IHE’s enrollment is Alaska Native or 10 percent is Native Hawaiian.  An assurance form, which is included in the application materials for this competition, must be signed by an official for the applicant and submitted.       To qualify as an eligible institution under the ANNH Program, an institution must--        (i)  Be accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association that the Secretary has determined to be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered;  (ii)  Be legally authorized by the State in which it is located to be a junior or community college or to provide an educational program for which it awards a bachelor's degree;  (iii)  Be designated as an “eligible institution,” as defined in 34 CFR 600.2, by demonstrating that it: (1)  has an enrollment of needy students as described in 34 CFR 607.3; and (2)  has low average educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent (FTE) undergraduate student as described in 34 CFR 607.4.          Note:  The notice announcing the FY 2020 process for designation of eligible institutions, and inviting applications for waiver of eligibility requirements, was published in the Federal Register on December 16, 2019 (84 FR 68434).  Only institutions that the Department determines are eligible, or which are granted a waiver under the process described in that notice, may apply for a grant in this program.        b.  Relationship between the Title III, Part A Programs and the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program: A grantee under the HSI Program, which is authorized under title V of the HEA, may not receive a grant under any HEA, title III, part A program.  The title III, part A programs are:  the Strengthening Institutions Program; the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities program; the Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions program; the Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions program; and the Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions program.  Furthermore, a current HSI program grantee may not give up its HSI grant in order to be eligible to receive a grant under ANNH or any title III, part A program as described in 34 CFR 607.2(g)(1).       An eligible HSI that is not a current grantee under the HSI program may apply for a FY 2020 grant under all title III, part A programs for which it is eligible, as well as receive consideration for a grant under the HSI program.  However, a successful applicant may receive only one grant as described in 34 CFR 607.2(g)(1).           An eligible IHE that submits applications for an Individual Development Grant and a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant in this competition may be awarded both in the same fiscal year.  However, we will not award a second Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant to an otherwise eligible IHE for an award year for which the IHE already has a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant award under the ANNH Program.  A grantee with an Individual Development Grant or a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant may be a subgrantee in one or more Cooperative Arrangement Development Grants.  The lead institution in a Cooperative Arrangement Development Grant must be an eligible institution.

The purpose of this grant program is to assist state boards to broaden preservation of, and increased online access to, historical records; develop and promote best practices; support activities that put the American people in touch with primary sources in their communities and online; promote the institutional advancement of organizations in underserved communities; and assist locally based repositories with training and tools to improve their stewardship abilities. The Commission will award grants to state historical records advisory boards to: • Operate state-based regrant programs that preserve historical records and make them available online • Provide educational and outreach programs, workshops, and other activities that enhance citizen and student engagement with historical records • Offer scholarships, training opportunities, and other programs that support institutional advancement among records repositories, especially those in underserved communities • Collaborate on projects with other organizations to address common problems or shared opportunities within a state or among a consortium of state archives • Hold or participate in meetings and public forums on statewide or national archival issues. The NHPRC encourages organizations to actively engage the public in the work of the project. Projects utilizing traditional approaches with a proven record of success, as well as projects testing innovative approaches, are welcome. All applications should outline a process for contacting institutions and individuals who participate in the board’s programs (i.e., regrant and training scholarship recipients, workshop attendees, etc.) to determine how they benefited from the program in which they participated. Applications should also outline a process for evaluating the board’s programs, determining their effectiveness, and proposing appropriate changes. For a comprehensive list of Commission limitations on funding, please see: \"What we do and do not fund\" (http://www.archives.gov/nhprc/apply/eligibility.html). Applications that consist entirely of ineligible activities will not be considered. Award Information The Commission offers two levels of funding. A Level I grant is for one year and for up to $12,000. A Level II grant is for one year and for up to $40,000 or for two years and for up to $80,000. Applicants may request either Level I or Level II funding, but not both. The Commission expects to make up to a total of 30 grants in this category for a total of up to $800,000. Grants begin no earlier than January 1, 2021. The Commission requires that grant recipients acknowledge NHPRC grant assistance in all publicity, publications, and other products that result from its support. Eligibility These grants are awarded only to state historical records advisory boards in each state, or to the state agency responsible for the state board, ordinarily the state archives. Another state agency, or a non-profit organization, such as a foundation or university, acting on behalf of the designated state agency may apply. States also include the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and United States territories. Cost Sharing The total costs of a project are shared between the NHPRC and the applicant organization. The Commission provides no more than 75 per cent of total project costs in the State Board Programming Grants category. NHPRC grant recipients are not permitted to use grant funds for indirect costs (as indicated in 2 CFR 2600.101). Cost sharing is required. The applicant's financial contribution may include both direct and indirect expenses, in-kind contributions, non-Federal third-party contributions, and any income earned directly by the project. Indirect costs must be listed under the applicant's cost sharing contribution. Other Requirements Applicant organizations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to submitting an application, maintain SAM registration throughout the application and award process, and include a valid DUNS number in their application. Details on SAM registration and requesting a DUNS number can be found at the System for Award Management website at https://sam.gov.

Projects may focus on broad historical movements in U.S. history, such as law (including the social and cultural history of the law), politics, social reform, business, military, the arts, and other aspects of the national experience, or may be centered on the papers of major figures from American history. Whether conceived as a thematic or a biographical edition, the historical value of the records and their expected usefulness to broad audiences must justify the costs of the project. The Commission is especially interested in projects to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. We encourage applications that use collections to examine the ideals behind the founding of the United States and the continual interpretation and debate over those ideals over the past 250 years. We welcome projects that engage the public, expand civic education, and promote understanding of the nation’s history, democracy, and culture from the founding era to the present day. The goal of this program is to provide access to, and editorial context for, the historical documents and records that tell the American story. Applicants should demonstrate familiarity with the best practices recommended by the Association for Documentary Editing (ADE) or the Modern Language Association (MLA) Committee on Scholarly Editions . All new projects (those which have never received NHPRC funding) must have definitive plans for publishing and preserving a digital edition which provides online access to a searchable, fully-transcribed and annotated collection of documents. New projects may also prepare print editions (including ebooks and searchable PDFs posted online) as part of their overall publishing plan, but the contents of those volumes must be published in a fully-searchable digital edition within a reasonable period of time following print publication. The NHPRC encourages projects to provide free public access to online editions. Projects that do not have definitive plans for digital dissemination and preservation in place at the time of application will not be considered. Grants are awarded to collaborative teams (including at least two scholar-editors, in addition to one or more archivists, digital scholars, data curators, and/or other support and technical staff, as necessary) for collecting, describing, preserving, compiling, transcribing, annotating, editing, encoding, and publishing documentary source materials online and in print. Eligible documentary edition projects typically focus on original manuscript or typewritten documents, but may also include other formats, such as analog audio and/or born-digital records. Because of the focus on historical documentary sources, grants do not support preparation of critical editions of published works unless such works are just a small portion of the larger project. This grant program does not support the production of film or video documentaries. For a comprehensive list of the Commission's limitations on funding, please see What We Do and Do Not Fund. Applications that consist entirely of ineligible activities will not be considered. Ongoing projects: Applicants from ongoing projects must demonstrate that they have successfully achieved the performance objectives associated with previous NHPRC awards; provide updated, current information, including a description of the new activities; describe the content and historical significance of the specific materials to be edited during the proposed grant period; show progress towards completing the edition; and justify costs in a new budget. Award Information A grant is for one year and for up to $175,000 per year. The Commission expects to make up to 25 grants in this category for a total of up to $3,000,000. Grants begin no earlier than January 1, 2021. The Commission requires that grant recipients acknowledge NHPRC grant assistance in all publications, publicity, and other products that result from its support. Eligibility • U.S. nonprofit organizations or institutions • U.S. colleges, universities, and other academic institutions • State or local government agencies • Federally-acknowledged or state-recognized Native American tribes or groups Cost Sharing The total costs of a project are shared between the NHPRC and the applicant organization. The Commission provides no more than 50 per cent of total project costs in the Publishing Historical Records in Documentary Editions category. NHPRC grant recipients are not permitted to use grant funds for indirect costs (as indicated in 2 CFR 2600.101). Cost sharing is required. The applicant’s financial contribution may include both direct and indirect expenses, in-kind contributions, non-Federal third-party contributions, and any income earned directly by the project. Indirect costs must be listed under the applicant’s cost sharing contribution. Other Requirements Applicant organizations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to submitting an application, maintain SAM registration throughout the application and award process, and include a valid DUNS number in their application. Details on SAM registration and requesting a DUNS number can be found at the System for Award Management website at https://sam.gov.

Progress for cancer research is highly dependent on the model systems being employed. While substantial progress has been made to establish models of increasing complexity to recapitulate aspects of human disease, a critical shortcoming persists for representation of the human immune system in those models. For example, various models can recapitulate key aspects of human T cell immunity but are less able to recapitulate human innate immunity and antibody responses, regardless of the human tissue source. In addition, few direct comparisons have been conducted of mice with humanized immune systems (HIS) derived using fetal vs. non-fetal human tissue sources (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/humanized-mouse-model-workshop). HIS mice are used extensively in immuno-oncology research, which is a high priority field of research with support through the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, and models that use human fetal tissue (HFT) remain the most advanced for mimicking human immune functions. More accessible model systems that account for human immune function are critically important for advancing this area of research.

Projects may focus on broad historical movements in U.S. history, such as law (including the social and cultural history of the law), politics, social reform, business, military, the arts, and other aspects of the national experience, or may be centered on the papers of major figures from American history. Whether conceived as a thematic or a biographical edition, the historical value of the records and their expected usefulness to broad audiences must justify the costs of the project. The Commission is especially interested in projects to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. We encourage applications that use collections to examine the ideals behind the founding of the United States and the continual interpretation and debate over those ideals over the past 250 years. We welcome projects that engage the public, expand civic education, and promote understanding of the nation’s history, democracy, and culture from the founding era to the present day. The goal of this program is to provide access to, and editorial context for, the historical documents and records that tell the American story. Applicants should demonstrate familiarity with the best practices recommended by the Association for Documentary Editing (ADE) or the Modern Language Association (MLA) Committee on Scholarly Editions . All new projects (those which have never received NHPRC funding) must have definitive plans for publishing and preserving a digital edition which provides online access to a searchable, fully-transcribed and annotated collection of documents. New projects may also prepare print editions (including ebooks and searchable PDFs posted online) as part of their overall publishing plan, but the contents of those volumes must be published in a fully-searchable digital edition within a reasonable period of time following print publication. The NHPRC encourages projects to provide free public access to online editions. Projects that do not have definitive plans for digital dissemination and preservation in place at the time of application will not be considered.

The main objectives of the agreement in support the Pacific Northwest Seismic Netw are: operation and maintenance of seismic stations and associated station metadata that meet ANSS standards, ensuring delivery of station waveform data and accurate station metadata to other ANSS networks and ANSS designated archives, adhering to the implementation of ANSS approved software standards to ensure efficient flow of data and information for robust delivery of ANSS products and services and interoperability, producing authoritative catalogs of earthquake source parameters and other ANSS products and services that meet ANSS standards, contributing to the operation and development of the Station Information System (SIS), working with ANSS and the ANSS National Implementation Committee (NIC) toward using or populating SIS for station inventory control and description and maintenance of station metadata and coordinating seismic monitoring activities with ANSS management and ANSS participants. The University of Oregon is uniquely qualified to carry out the objectives above as they are the co-operators (with University of Washington) of the PNSN, a USGS-supported seismic network in the Pacific Nothwest, which is a region of significant seismic hazard posed by the offshore Cascadia subduction zone. University of Oregon also has a well-developed network staff that is also of great benefit to this proposed study. The PIs have been extensively involved with this effort as the seismic network operators. In addition, specialized equipment is needed for monitoring and has been deployed by the University of Oregon in the regions of monitoring. Some of the field sensors and central recording and computing equipment is university-owned and would not be available to another source. Furthermore, data from the instruments is transmitted to the universities’ facilities and relocation of the data receiving point and telemetry equipment would be costly and time-consuming."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"Grants to Enhance State Adult Protective Services FY2020","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323973","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>HHS-2020-ACL-AOA-EJSG-0407</b>","contentSnippet":"HHS-2020-ACL-AOA-EJSG-0407","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323973","categories":["ISS|Income Security and Social Services"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"opportunity-id":"323973"},{"opportunity-number":"HHS-2020-ACL-AOA-EJSG-0407"},{"opportunity-title":"Grants to Enhance State Adult Protective Services FY2020"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Income Security and Social Services"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.747"},{"eligible-applicants":"State governments"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Eligible applicants are the state government offices that adminster the state's adult protective services and/or elder protective services program.

The primary purpose of these activities is to check for and extinguish any smoldering hot spots, while at the same time trying to minimize damage to the structure and its’ contents. In addition to the hazards associated with debris when taking down ceilings and the other functions involved with overhaul operations, there is considerable exposure to toxic chemicals, gases, and particulate matters during overhaul firefighting. Often these chemicals, particulate matters, and potentially toxic gases present during the cold smoke environment may be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through skin contact.    Early in the overhaul operations, firefighters normally wear their self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) as this is their only means of complete respiratory protection. Later in the operations, it is common for firefighters to remove the SCBA when the carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, measured by a handheld instrument, drops below the 8 hour Occupation Safety Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 35 parts per million (ppm). Firefighters remove their SCBA equipment because the overhaul environment is hot, the SCBA is heavy and cumbersome to work in, and must be changed periodically, approximately every 30 minutes. Unfortunately, CO concentrations do not correlate with the concentrations of the multiple harmful chemicals that can be present in the overhaul environment, nor do they in any way indicate the hazards associated with inhaling particulates.    Structural firefighters and fire investigators need a respirator system that offers protection against the chemical and vapor hazards present in the overhaul environment. The technology must be capable of protecting personnel present during overhaul operations from airborne hazards and carcinogens. Prior development efforts by TDA Research and Avon Protection were successful in addressing this void by producing and delivering to DHS prototypes of the overhaul filters for an Operational Field Assessment (OFA), executed at the National Fire Academy in Emittsburg, MD in October 2018. Additional overhaul filters were also provided to DHS at the conclusion of the OFA.   Since that time, TDA Research and Avon Protection Systems are continuing development efforts of the overhaul filter which include additional testing of various carbon lots to ensure that if a lower capacity carbon lot is introduced the filter system would still offer the required user protection. TDA Research and Avon Protection will develop a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified stackable filter system that can be used as a traditional APR or with a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR). This filter system offers fire personnel involved in overhaul operations protection against the inhalation of harmful vapors and chemicals present in the overhaul environment."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"National Dental Practice-Based Research Network Infrastructure Access (X01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322956","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>PAR-20-073</b>","contentSnippet":"PAR-20-073","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322956","categories":["HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"322956"},{"opportunity-number":"PAR-20-073"},{"opportunity-title":"National Dental Practice-Based Research Network Infrastructure Access (X01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Health"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.121"},{"eligible-applicants":"State governmentsCounty governmentsCity or township governmentsSpecial district governmentsIndependent school districtsPublic and State controlled institutions of higher educationNative American tribal governments (Federally recognized)Public housing authorities/Indian housing authoritiesNative American tribal organizations (other than Federally recognized tribal governments)Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationFor profit organizations other than small businessesSmall businessesOthers (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Other Eligible Applicants include the following:  Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISISs); Eligible Agencies of the Federal Government; Faith-based or Community-based Organizations; Hispanic-serving Institutions; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); Indian/Native American Tribal Governments (Other than Federally Recognized); Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Organizations); Regional Organizations; Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) ; U.S. Territory or Possession; Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are not eligible to apply.

Additional information regarding the Plastics Innovation Challenge can be found by visiting https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-launches-plastics-innovation-challenge. Current recycling strategies often do not allow for cost-effective recycling of commonly used plastics. Typical recycling techniques can result in diminished material properties, which limit opportunities to produce products from recycled material with equal or greater value. However, there is an opportunity to advance new technologies that use recycled materials to reduce manufacturing energy consumption for some of the most prevalent plastics by up to 50 percent, including those used in grocery bags and beverage bottles. BETO and AMO have identified significant potential to improve the carbon efficiency and energy efficiency of plastics recycling technologies. To achieve this, research is needed to: - Develop novel polymers that are designed for infinite recyclability; - Create innovative deconstruction pathways for existing polymers that generate high-value products; and - Establish a consistent framework for evaluating carbon and energy efficiency across potential material flows and transformations.

Over the last several years, the Government of Egypt (GOE) has created an increasingly healthy macroeconomic environment by implementing reforms such as establishing a flexible exchange rate, consolidating the budget, and addressing regulatory constraints critical to business growth. While these reforms were necessary and set Egypt on a path toward greater economic growth and stability, these reforms had some negative repercussions. Egypt is recovering from a currency crisis that created a rapid depreciation of the Egyptian pound, price inflation, and loss of real income by Egyptians. These macroeconomic shocks are linked with sustained population growth, urbanization, and continued migration due to economic circumstances. Although the unemployment rate is edging downward, the absolute number of unemployed is high: over 2.3 million people are currently unemployed and the number will likely increase as Egypt’s population grows. Moreover, this unemployment level does not include the underemployed and discouraged workers who no longer seek employment. Egypt requires rapid and sustainable private sector-led job growth to counter high, growing, and chronic unemployment and underemployment.As the GOE enacts reforms to further improve the business environment, USAID/Egypt is committed to helping Egypt redress persistent unemployment and underemployment, especially women and youth. This should be accomplished through accelerated, inclusive private sector-led job growth that will generate employment. Research reveals that Egypt’s employment challenges are multifaceted. Egypt is the most populous country in the Middle East region and has a high unemployment level in absolute terms. Each year about 800,000 people join the labor market; of these, about 200,000 become unemployed, even at the current GDP growth rate of 5.6 to 6 percent. Thus, the pool of unemployed could grow by one million people in five years. The structure of the unemployed poses special challenges since it is young (67 percent under age 30) and often female (48 percent). In addition, the national female labor force participation rate is exceedingly low (by some estimates, as low as 19 percent). This level and structure of unemployment is an established risk factor for political instability, and it directly compromises the Mission’s overall goal of creating an inclusive and prosperous Egypt where the entire population shares in and benefits from economic growth. The mission is targeting under-served communities which may include a range of geographic locations such as Upper Egypt or urban centers.In a review of assistance activities working on these challenges, USAID/Egypt examined its Strengthening Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development (SEED) activity as well as business development activities supported by the Egyptian private sector, the GOE, and other donors to identify successful approaches that led to business and job growth. The Mission reviewed literature and development experiences, particularly concerning innovation, new firm growth, and targeted technical assistance to rapidly growing small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The Mission also reviewed approaches to generate rapid firm and employment growth by supporting a buyer-led transaction strategy between large, anchor firms and rapidly growing SMEs in their supply (value) chains. The Mission is engaging with private sector entities in Egypt, the United States, and elsewhere to evaluate how these different approaches can be applied in Egypt to generate rapid, sustainable, and private sector-based employment growth.Finally, the Mission considered other factors in the business enabling environment that impede business and job growth in Egypt. Discussions with private sector and GOE officials indicated that targeted efforts to improve the business environment may be required to sustain and accelerate SME expansion. Areas such as simplified tax policies, a streamlined regulatory environment, and improved access to financing for investment were emphasized in these discussions. Activities that work directly with SMEs may encounter other policy and practical constraints to business growth and employment generation. If those impediments become prominent, the capacity to ameliorate them will be critical. The 2020 World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report shows that Egypt currently is ranked 156th for paying taxes, an area that could be much improved and have strong business growth impacts, according to recent literature.How the Mission Proposes to Resolve this ProblemThe Mission is considering a new award, Business Egypt, that will build on successes from the USAID Strengthening Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development (SEED) activity as well as efforts by the GOE, international donors, and the private sector. The Mission hypothesizes that the goal of accelerated inclusive private sector-led growth can be achieved by:● Assisting new and growing SMEs. ● Building value chain linkages between anchor firms (buyers) and SMEs (suppliers). ● Enhancing the business enabling environment for SME growth. The Mission is developing a three-prong approach under Business Egypt that focuses on business innovation and investment to achieve economic growth that will create greater employment opportunities. The three components are:1. Assisting New and Growing SMEs by Supporting Innovation and Providing Targeted AssistanceStrengthening Promising New Startup Companies through Business Incubators and Accelerators: Through SEED and other donor activities, experience shows that incubators and accelerators have an important role in supporting emerging, innovative firms – from refining startup ideas and innovations to assisting successful new firms as they emerge in the crucial early growth stages. These approaches are also important in targeting under-served communities. In the last several years, Egypt has shown remarkable growth in the innovation space. Egypt has had success with incubators and accelerators that take nascent firms and help them develop into thriving small businesses. Advancing these dynamic and innovative businesses into fast growing SMEs is important for private sector job growth.  Strengthening Firm-Level Efficiency and Operations for Fast Growing SMEs: SMEs can be strengthened in various ways. Recent experience in Egypt shows that BDS centers that provide diagnostic assessments and targeted training to fast growing SMEs can substantially improve business operations and production efficiencies. This targeted approach to increase efficiency and productivity of SMEs, particularly those that have identified large buyers in value chains, is critical to rapid and sustainable job growth. In addition, many SMEs would benefit from better access to market information, possibly through BDS centers providing fee-based services.2. Building Value Chain Linkages Between Anchor Firms and SMEs Identify and Develop New Value Chain Contacts for Anchor Firms and SMEs: A buyer-led approach links SMEs with the broader market through connections with large anchor firms. This activity will identify and strengthen commercial, productive relationships between these anchor firms and their supplier SMEs with a focus on Egypt’s growing domestic market or large Egypt-based international suppliers. This activity will also seek solutions to some of the challenges faced by the buyer-led approach, including better predicting the market conditions and growth prospects, properly identifying buyers and SME suppliers in value chains, and providing enough targeted assistance to improve the capability of SMEs to meet buyer requirements.Strengthen Existing Anchor Firm Linkages with SMEs for Buyer-Led Growth: This activity will work with anchor firms and their SME sources to strengthen business processes, helping anchor firms and SMEs become more efficient and productive, which will lead to business and employment growth. Access to Finance and Investment: Businesses of all types in Egypt complain about inadequate credit and the cost of finance, which are undeniable constraints to firm growth. Improving access to finance and investment opportunities, however, does not always require more credit or debt instruments. Experience suggests that expanding the definition of collateral, to include both mobile and fixed assets, can have a significant impact on financing for smaller firms. Similarly, improving credit information sharing across financial institutions has demonstrated a positive impact on firm-level access to credit in recent years. Business Egypt will consider interventions that seek to address financial limitations that constrain firm growth in the Egyptian context.3. Enhancing the Business Enabling Environment for SME GrowthImproving Policies and Regulations for Businesses: Businesses, small and large, complain that an adverse policy and regulatory environment in Egypt is the most serious constraint to business growth and job creation. Business Egypt expects to consider specific aspects of the policy or regulatory environment that constrain SME growth, particularly surrounding business tax policy and administration. Simplifying Registration Processes for New Businesses. One-stop shops and citizen service centers established by USAID show that it is possible to dramatically accelerate business registration and licensing processes to enable new or informal businesses to join the formal sector. Evidence from other countries shows that these types of enhancements can stimulate employment growth. Business Egypt expects to continue to support such approaches. Desired OutcomesUSAID is looking for a series of strategic investments of technical assistance that will achieve the following desired outcomes:● Accelerated growth of promising SMEs that unleashes the talents of entrepreneurs for dynamic employment growth.● Increased growth of SMEs that receive targeted BDS services, which leads to increases in employment.● Increased and stronger linkages between SMEs and larger anchor firms, which leads to job growth through business investment.● 20 percent of new jobs created in under-served communities.● Improved business enabling environment for SMEs, which fosters more rapid SME and employment growth.USAID Requirements and Objectives of Business Egypt DesignCo-design EffortsUSAID/Egypt hosted broad consultations with SME owners and visited with small and large growing businesses across Egypt in preparation for this RFI. The Mission also expects to host at least one industry day and undertake potential post-award co-design efforts. Private Sector Engagement USAID/Egypt will continue to engage the private sector in shaping this award to maximize sustainable job growth. Many modalities for this are possible and input from the private sector is encouraged.Serving Under-Served Communities The Mission continues to support the registration of businesses in hard-to-reach communities, especially through its previously SEED-supported one-stop shops. The Mission is considering a similar approach to assist SMEs to become more formal, including those owned and managed by women or people in under-served communities (such as Upper Egypt and urban areas). Coordination with Other DonorsIn addition to the GOE, the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Union, and German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ) are also engaged in business and job-growth activities. USAID wishes to design this award to leverage other donor efforts and minimize duplication.Journey to Self-RelianceThis award will align with USAID’s efforts to support Egypt’s Journey to Self-Reliance by accelerating the commitment and capacity of the GOE to provide inclusive development and strengthen market-driven economic policy.RFI Questions for Public Response To improve the ultimate design of the new Business Egypt award, USAID/Egypt invites the participation and reflection of private firms on the construct, content, objectives, and approaches of this award. Thus, the Mission poses the following questions for an RFI. Respondents should limit their responses to one page per question below (up to eight pages total) and return them by February 20, 2020. Send responses to Benjamin Lawrence @ blawrence@usaid.gov and Mona Beshai @ mbeshai@usaid.gov1.What are the most important regulatory, policy, financial, or other issues inhibiting business and employment growth of Egyptian SMEs?2.What does the evidence show for the potential of business incubators, accelerators, one-stop shops, and business development service centers to generate rapid business and employment growth (what are realistic targets, including cost per job created)?3.How can a new award best identify large anchor firms and promising SMEs in a buyer-led growth strategy?4.How can the award best strengthen firm-level efficiency of Egyptian SMEs and engage local institutions to do so?5.Under what conditions and resource constraints would this approach foster competitive new firms and significant business and employment growth in Egypt?6.How can the award best link with local and U.S.-based partners to support the goals of this award?7.What activities or policies might encourage more female participation in either business ownership or the Egyptian workforce?8.Do you have any other comments or suggestions?"},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"U.S. Embassy La Paz - PAS Annual Program Statement","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322969","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>PAS-LAPAZ-FY20-01</b>","contentSnippet":"PAS-LAPAZ-FY20-01","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=322969","categories":["O|Other (see text field entitled \"Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity\" for clarification)"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"322969"},{"opportunity-number":"PAS-LAPAZ-FY20-01"},{"opportunity-title":"U.S. Embassy La Paz - PAS Annual Program Statement"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative AgreementGrant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Other (see text field entitled \"Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity\" for clarification)"},{"category-explanation":"Public Diplomacy Programs"},{"cfda-numbers":"19.040"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"• Registered, not-for-profit organizations, including think tanks and civil society/nongovernmental organizations with programming experience • Individuals  • Non-profit or governmental educational institutions • Governmental institutions"},{"agency-code":"DOS-BOL"},{"agency-name":"Department of StateU.S. Mission to Bolivia"},{"posted-date":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"close-date":"Aug 31, 2020"},{"last-updated-date":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"award-ceiling":"$40,000"},{"award-floor":"$1,000"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":""},{"expected-number-of-awards":""},{"description":"PAS La Paz invites proposals for programs that strengthen cultural, educational, professional and scientific ties between the U.S. and Bolivia through cultural and exchange programming that highlights shared values and promotes bilateral cooperation.

The main objectives of the agreement in support of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) are: . operation and maintenance seismic stations and associated station metadata that meet ANSS standards, ensuring delivery of station waveform data and accurate station metadata to other ANSS networks and ANSS designated archives, adhering to the implementation of ANSS approved software standards to ensure efficient flow of data and information for robust delivery of ANSS products and services and interoperability, producing authoritative catalogs of earthquake source parameters and other ANSS products and services that meet ANSS standards, contributing to the operation and development of the Station Information System (SIS), working with ANSS and the ANSS National Implementation Committee (NIC) toward using or populating SIS for station inventory control and description and maintenance of station metadata and coordinating seismic monitoring activities with ANSS management and ANSS participants. The University of Washington is uniquely qualified to carry out the work described above as they are the co-operators (with University of Oregon) of the PNSN, a USGS-supported seismic network in the Pacific Nothwest, which is a region of significant seismic hazard posed by the offshore Cascadiasubduction zone. University of Washington also has a well-developed network staff that is also of great benefit to this proposed study. The PIs have been extensively involved with this effort as the seismic network operator. In addition, specialized equipment is needed for monitoring and has been deployed by the University of Washington in the regions of monitoring. Some of the field sensors and central recording and computing equipment is university-owned and would not be available to another source. Furthermore, data from the instruments is transmitted to the universities’ facilities and relocation of the data receiving point and telemetry equipment would be costly and time-consuming."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","title":"COPS-COMMUNITY-POLICING-DEVELOPMENT-2020","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=324005","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:36 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:36Z","content":"<b>COPS-COMMUNITY-POLICING-DEVELOPMENT-2020</b>","contentSnippet":"COPS-COMMUNITY-POLICING-DEVELOPMENT-2020","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=324005","categories":["LJL|Law, Justice and Legal Services"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:36.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"324005"},{"opportunity-number":"COPS-COMMUNITY-POLICING-DEVELOPMENT-2020"},{"opportunity-title":"COPS-COMMUNITY-POLICING-DEVELOPMENT-2020"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative AgreementGrant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Law, Justice and Legal Services"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"16.710"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"This solicitation is open to all public governmental agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes, profit and nonprofit institutions, institutions of higher education, community groups, and faith-based organizations.

It is the potential responder’s responsibility to monitor the above forums for the release of any further information.

It should also be noted that responding to or providing comments in response to this RFI will not give any advantage to any organization in any subsequent procurement action.   The Kingdom of Eswatini Government Condom Program Overview    The goal of the Eswatini Condom Program in the next five years (as articulated in the National Condom Strategy 2018 to 2022[1]) is to improve access to quality and affordable male and female condoms for all sexually active individuals to contribute to the prevention of HIV, other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), and of unintended pregnancies.   The National Condom Program is led by the Kingdom of Eswatini Ministry of Health (MOH) under the Sexual and Reproductive Health Unit (SRHU). It is part of the Family Planning Program and is supported by a technical working group comprising of other government departments, civil society organizations, private sector and development partners which support the condom program with planning, coordination, quantification, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.    Currently, 90 percent of public sector condoms are procured with funding provided by the USG through its President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program, and the remainder by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF). PEPFAR-procured condoms are distributed by the Central Medical Stores (CMS) and a USG-funded effort implemented by Population Service International (PSI). CMS distributes to health facilities, and some civil society partners, which distribute them to target populations. PSI distributes condoms to retail outlets, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other partners. The MOH’s vision is to assume responsibility for procurement of public sector condoms, and to centralize all condom storage in the national-level CMS.    Condom promotion is currently unstructured and largely driven by partners. The two structured and consistent approaches to condom promotion are provided through health facilities in consultation rooms mainly as part of family planning and through the category branding for young people. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Southern Africa supporting PEPFAR in Eswatini intends to consolidate its support for condom promotion resources to coordinate and target promotion of condom-use.    In order to facilitate widespread use and access, free government-supported condoms make up 90 percent of the market share, with the remaining 10 percent supplied by the commercial sector. To ensure sustainability of condom distribution and access in Eswatini, there is a need to increase the commercial sector market share for those willing to buy condoms and target the free condoms to those unable to afford them.    USAID’s support to the Eswatini National Condom Program   USAID/Southern Africa (USAID/SA) will continue its support for Eswatini’s National Condom Strategy and is committed to continue the shift towards a more sustainable, equitable, and market-based approach that will improve access to male and female condoms and lubricants. USAID/SA support will aim to improve coordination, increase commodity security, increase demand and access, and improve correct and consistent utilization of condoms, with a particular focus on youth and males.   USAID/SA will continue to work closely with the Eswatini Government and civil society on forecasting and distribution and promotion strategies. USG PEPFAR future support to Eswatini Government’s Condom Program is envisioned to include the following activities: · Continued procurement of condoms for the public sector.  · Support for forecasting and quantification for condom procurements.  · Support for the full integration of public sector condoms into the Central Medical Stores.  · Strengthen the Government of Eswatini MOH stewardship for the National Condom Program  · Support a market development approach to optimize the targeted provision of free condoms and lubricants, and encourage private and commercial sectors to expand marketing and distributing condoms and lubricants as well as developing innovative solutions to increasing condom use; · Establish a sustainable distribution and tracking system for the free condoms; and · Develop an attractive condom promotion and demand creation strategy through on-going understanding of current condom use, perceived availability, and preference among consumers.   USAID’s Envisioned Future Activities   Building on the previous PEPFAR work highlighted above, this RFI seeks to gather information from local, regional and international organizations with interest in and capacity to provide support in the following areas: · Strengthen the MOH stewardship, leadership, management and coordination of the condom program including data collection, analysis and utilization; · Support the national condom distribution system for public sector (free) condoms from national to non-health facility sub regional levels and outlets · Support promotion for targeted free condoms including category branding, using evidence · Facilitate market access for commercial and private condom sector   Requested information    The objective of the RFI is to obtain information on potential local, regional and international organizations that are interested and have the capability to support USAID/Southern Africa’s contribution to the Kingdom of Eswatini Government’s Condom Program by facilitating access and demand for public sector (free distribution) condoms and facilitate market access for the commercial condom sector.   Interested organizations should submit a Corporate Capability Statement that addresses the below-listed core competencies and experience (as relates to USAID’s Envisioned Future Activities listed above); corporate/company data; facilities or office locations; and contact information.   Under the Corporate Capability Statement, interested organizations should briefly describe their qualifications, skills and capacity to assemble an adequate team to address the areas below:   · Experience in promotion and distribution of condoms and/or other related commodities or products including experience working with host governments to develop or improve distribution systems; · Types of commodities and products distributed; · Annual volume of commodities or products distributed; · Description of distribution at national and sub-national to the last mile; and · Capacity of the institution to distribute at national and sub-national level.  Please do not submit an application or resumes as they will be discarded. Responses will be held confidential. Proprietary information should not be sent. Organizations will receive an electronic confirmation acknowledging receipt of your response. USAID will not provide responses to any questions or comments submitted in response to this request. USAID reserves the right to retain and utilize the submitted information for its planning purposes.   Information provided in response to this RFI must not exceed five pages.

The main objectives of the agreement are:  operation and maintenance seismic stations and associated station metadata of the University of Nevada Western Great Basin Seismic Network, that meet ANSS standards, ensuring delivery of station waveform data and accurate station metadata to other ANSS networks and ANSS designated archives, adhering to the implementation of ANSS approved software standards to ensure efficient flow of data and information for robust delivery of ANSS products and services and interoperability, producing authoritative catalogs of earthquake source parameters and other ANSS products and services that meet ANSS standards, contributing to the operation and development of the Station Information System (SIS), working with ANSS and the ANSS National Implementation Committee (NIC) toward using or populating SIS for station inventory control and description and maintenance of station metadata and coordinating seismic monitoring activities with ANSS management and ANSS participants.   UNR’s unique qualifications are essential to the successful and efficient accomplishment of the continuing monitoring of earthquakes in the Intermountain West region, with particular emphasis on seismicity in Nevada and in Eastern California. The principal investigators have unique and superior expertise regarding seismicity and deformation in their regions. UNR has a well-developed network staff that is also of great benefit to this proposed study. The PIs have been extensively involved with this effort as seismic network operators.

The park and MVMA are excited about the possibility of harnessing the power of new technology to meet Mesa Verde's established program objectives of enhancing visitor experiences, improving access to park information, and utilizing technology to engage new audiences. This agreement is an expansion of the three pilot episodes that were created through a partnership between KSJD Public Radio and Mesa Verde Country. The first season produced under this agreement will explore the topic of trade in the ancient Southwest. Some items that will be discussed include copper, shells, chocolate, pottery, and feathers.

Please carefully follow all instructions below. Priority Region: All regions of Niger Program Objectives:  The objective of Julia Taft Fund for Refugees is to meet one-time, low-cost projects to address important gaps in refugee protection and assistance. PRM’s Taft Refugee Fund is intended to meet gaps in ongoing refugee programs that can be filled locally through projects of up to $25,000 and that are not already being addressed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), other international organizations (IOs), or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are already receiving U.S. government funding. The Taft Refugee Fund is intended primarily to support projects that assist refugees or refugee returnees. The Taft Refugee Fund is intended for projects that include a target beneficiary base of at least 50 percent refugees or returnees. These should be one- time interventions, not sustained programs.  The Taft Refugee Fund cannot provide direct support to host governments. The program may entertain proposals for support of international NGOs (INGO), but the preference is to support reliable local NGOs to encourage capacity building for smaller, local partners. There are approximately 218,000 refugees in Niger,[1] who receive assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), other international organizations (IOs), or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receiving U.S. government funding. Unfortunately, many of the refugees’ needs are not met by these International Organizations. The Taft Refugee Fund is intended to meet gaps in refugee assistance. Refugees are living in difficult conditions due to limited of funding for interventions. This iteration of the Julia Taft Fund for Refugees is seeking interventions in the reported gaps in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Education, Food Security and Livelihoods, Health and Nutrition, and Protection. Beneficiaries: Vulnerable refugee and/or returnee households in Niger. B.

These lifetime predictions should be based on the combination of mechanical and chemical aging of materials in operational environments. They should also encompass interactive materials effects. Lastly, the predicted failures sites within a component or system should be presented via a virtual and/or augmented reality visualization techniques. These visualization mechanisms are intended to allow field operators to analyze the results in an intuitive way and implement maintenance schedules and/or corrective actions.b. Investigating Radiation Effects in Quantum Information TechnologiesNaval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division is interested in receiving proposals for the investigation of radiation effects in critical components used in quantum information systems. For quantum information technologies to be effectively implemented in real world conditions beyond the lab, susceptibility to various forms of radiation must be characterized. To date, little is known regarding the impacts of various forms of radiation on these systems and whether these concepts are even capable of enabling improved operations in a high radiation environment. Robust efforts, therefore, are required to develop the scientific understanding of radiation effects in qubit architectures, as well as the integrated photonic structures that are used to generate and manipulate entangled photons. Qubit architectures that will be implemented in future quantum computers are still under intense investigation. There are many physical implementations of qubits. Several implementations, however, are gaining popularity for use in large-scale quantum computation. Those include, but not limited to, superconducting Josephson junctions (JJs) and supercooled trapped ions. Although qubit research is still an active area of research, now is the time to understand potential vulnerabilities caused by radiation exposure. Thus, providing timely technical leadership that will enable the R&D community to undertake efforts to improve qubit resiliency in such environments.In addition to the development of qubit architectures utilizing low-temperature physical phenomenon, researchers have begun realizing chip-scale approaches for generating photon entanglement utilizing integrate silicon photonics. Despite major advancements, little is known about the susceptibility of these chip-based photonic quantum systems to radiation such as gamma rays and high-energy electrons. As is the case with optical fibers, ionizing radiation can damage the semiconductor’s crystalline lattice, as well as change the index of refraction by modifying the doping concentration via generation of free carriers. NSWC Crane is interested in basic research that enables advanced understanding of susceptibility of chip-based photon entanglement and quantum correlation measurements to radiation induced single event upsets, as well as long-term exposure (total ionizing dose). c. High optically transparent coating for electromagnetic interference (EMI) protection Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division is interested in receiving proposals for the development of a transparent optical coating capable of providing electromagnetic interference (EMI) protection. To achieve this EMI level of protection the coating needs to have a sheet resistance of <20 Ohms/sq. Current EMI coatings typically comprise of indium tin oxide (ITO) which allows the coating to meet this low sheet resistance as well as be optically transparent. The drawback of ITO is its lower optical transmission across the spectrum of visible through short-wave infrared wavelengths. We seek novel approaches beyond existing ITO for materials with the same sheet resistance but with an optical transmission >97% from 400 nm to 1600 nm and a reflectance <1.5% on the same wavelength range. The solution needs to adhere and be compatible with either fused silica or n-BK7 glass. Solution may be either passive or active (i.e. needs power); however, active solutions will be evaluated based on power usage comparable to the platform’s aperture and existing power draw.d. Spectrum Machine LearningThe Navy deploys multiple spectrum sensing systems continuously on air, sea, and submarine assets. There is a desire to use machine learning techniques to allow these sensors to more quickly and efficiently understand the signals they receive in order for sailors to maintain a better awareness of their environment. Machine Learning has proven itself in other domains such as image processing, audio processing, and text processing as a powerful tool for pattern recognition, anomaly detection and other applications.

The purpose of this Act is to provide funding for the selection, restoration, rehabilitation, and improvement of wildlife habitat, wildlife management research, and the distribution of information produced by the projects. The Act was amended on October 23, 1970, to include funding for hunter safety programs and the development or the operation and maintenance of firearm and archery ranges. Congress saw a need for additional funds to support hunter education and shooting range development, if States were to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The Congressional Resource Committee heard from sportsmen¿s organizations that States were not using their possible allotments to support these programs, or there was not a consistent level of effort to further the future of hunting. As a result, Congress passed the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000 and as part of this Act created the Firearm and Bowhunter Education and Safety Program (Section 10 or EHE) to address these concerns. The passage of Section 10 set aside $7.5 million in 2001 and 2002 and $8 million thereafter to ¿enhance¿ existing hunter education or shooting range programs. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act was also amended on May 10, 2019 with the passage of the Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act, Pub.

Projects responsive to this solicitation must aim to establish a robust and reproducible set of differentiation design rules, predictive models, real-time sensing, control, and quality assurance methods, and integrate them into a workable differentiation strategy. They must develop a fundamental understanding of how cells develop, including mechanisms, molecular machinery, dynamics, and cell-cell interactions, and use this understanding to manipulate cells purposefully. Investigators can choose any undifferentiated cell type, from any animal species, as a starting point and choose any appropriate functional product (cell, organoid, etc.) with real-world relevance.This solicitation parallels NSF’s investment inUnderstanding the Rules of Life (URoL): Predicting Phenotype, NSF’s Big Idea focused on predicting the set of observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism based on its genetic makeup and the nature of its environment and applies it to understanding and accomplishing the intentional and guided differentiation of an undifferentiated cell into cells, organoids or tissues with predetermined activities and functions. The process of differentiation involves a multiplex combination of signaling molecules, receptors, promoters, markers, and regulators that dynamically interact to direct cell development and behavior. While individual inducers of native differentiation have been identified and employed to create specialized cell types, we still cannot engineer stem cells to allow for synthetic induction of differentiation along a predetermined path that can be actively monitored and manipulated on-the-fly. Such control of differentiation will enable the realization of individualized medicine in areas such as regenerative medicine, cancer treatment with engineered killer cells, the development of functional cells and tissues to treat disease, environmental control and monitoring, adaptive sensing, as well as the scalable and reproducible application of 3D organoids in drug testing. The convergence of many disciplines is necessary to answer the fundamental questions and devise the tools needed to realize truly deterministic cell induction and differentiation strategies. As such, investigators are encouraged to form interdisciplinary teams with expertise in developmental biology, stem cell biology, cell biology, engineering, synthetic and systems biology, computation, sensing, and physics. Proposals will not be responsive to this solicitation if they address only one aspect of the differentiation process or aim to create a functional living product without improving our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie developmental processes. Collaborative proposals, of a duration up to 4 years, with budgets between $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 will be considered. Proposed budgets must be justified by project scope and need for complementary expertise.The solicitation will support teams of three or more PI/co-PIs and senior personnel.Proposals with only one PI or one PI with one other senior personnel are not permitted.Reflecting the need for thoughtful collaboration and planning required for these projects, Letters of Intent are required to be submitted prior to submission of a full proposal."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Stakeholders&#8217; Consultation Workshops: Feed the Future Bangladesh Livestock and Nutrition Activity","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323070","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>FTF-BANGLADESH-CONSULTATION-WORKSHOP</b>","contentSnippet":"FTF-BANGLADESH-CONSULTATION-WORKSHOP","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323070","categories":["AG|Agriculture"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323070"},{"opportunity-number":"FTF-BANGLADESH-CONSULTATION-WORKSHOP"},{"opportunity-title":"Stakeholders’ Consultation Workshops: Feed the Future Bangladesh Livestock and Nutrition Activity"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Other"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Agriculture"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"98.001"},{"eligible-applicants":"Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":""},{"agency-code":"USAID-BAN"},{"agency-name":"Agency for International DevelopmentBangladesh USAID-Dhaka"},{"posted-date":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"close-date":"This is a Notice for a Stakeholders Consultation Workshop.

The goal of the BAA is to develop efficient and practical protocols and techniques that allow Quantum Characterization, Verification, and Validation (QCVV) of larger systems with direct relevance to Fault Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC), and to demonstrate these protocols on intermediate-scale systems. In this BAA, intermediate-scale refers to systems of size 10-20 qubits and larger systems greater than 20 qubits. Proposals are sought to develop reliable, efficient, and scalable protocols for evaluating intermediate-scale quantum systems and selectively characterizing only the subset of information relevant to FTQC. These new methods are sought as the next advances that will empower the quantum computing community to reliably interpret and evaluate emerging larger-scale quantum systems, and not merely a continuation of work applicable to one or two-qubit QCVV. The program success criterion is to identify the subset of information needed to characterize, verify, and validate a system’s behavior relevant for FTQC and create a suite of procedures for measuring that informationQuantum computing research has reached an exciting phase where controllable multi-qubit systems are becoming available across a number of venues, including academic laboratories, industry offerings, and even on the cloud. Demonstrations of progressively more sophisticated algorithms are occurring, and achieving ‘quantum advantage’ seems to be on the horizon. In order to evaluate and continue to improve quantum hardware, relevant protocols must be identified and used to characterize, verify, and validate the performance of these intermediate-scale quantum processing systems. However, QCVV of these increasingly complex quantum systems remains a challenge. The challenge being that as the number of qubits in a quantum system increases, the Hilbert space that defines the system grows exponentially, and the resources needed for complete characterization correspondingly grows exponentially. These resource limitations are already being encountered in small quantum systems of about 10 qubits. For continued progress, an additional challenge to overcome is to be able to identify a smaller subset of parameters that allow system performance to be predicted and understood for applications of interest without the need for full characterization.Two categories of proposals are sought for this BAA. The first category seeks proposals that integrate theoretical and experimental research to fully identify and address the challenges of QCVV for intermediate-scale quantum systems. The second category seeks theoretical research that may significantly advance QCVV for intermediate-scale quantum systems through novel approaches that retire a set of key challenges."},{"version":"5"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Black Lung Clinics Program","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=315915","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>HRSA-20-027</b>","contentSnippet":"HRSA-20-027","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=315915","categories":["HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"315915"},{"opportunity-number":"HRSA-20-027"},{"opportunity-title":"Black Lung Clinics Program"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Health"},{"category-explanation":"https://grants.hrsa.gov/2010/Web2External/Interface/FundingCycle/ExternalView.aspx?fCycleID=306d4f30-a170-4ce1-9b79-98a0a4079d0f"},{"cfda-numbers":"93.965"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Any state or public or private entity may apply.

The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as amended by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution to develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have the clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability). SBIR/STTR Program Overview: The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are Government-wide programs authorized under Section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. § 638). The objectives of the SBIR program are to (1) stimulate technological innovation in the private sector, (2) strengthen the role of Small Business Concerns in meeting Federal R&D needs, (3) increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R&D activities, (4) foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned Small Business Concerns, and (5) improve the return on investment from Federally funded research and economic benefits to the Nation. The objective of the STTR program is to stimulate cooperative partnerships of ideas and technologies between Small Business Concerns and partnering Research Institutions through Federally funded R&D activities. ARPA-E administers a joint SBIR/STTR program in accordance with the Small Business Act and the SBIR and STTR Policy Directives issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). ARPA-E provides SBIR/STTR funding in three phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase IIS). Program Overview: The Aviation-class Synergistically Cooled Electric-motors with iNtegrated Drives (ASCEND) program supports the development of novel lightweight and ultra-efficient electric motors, drives , and associated thermal management system (collectively referred to as the all-electric powertrain) that will facilitate net-zero carbon emissions in the single-aisle, 150-200 passenger commercial aircraft segment. This FOA represents part of a wider ARPA-E effort in the development of enabling technologies for long-range (≥ 2,800 nautical miles), carbon neutral commercial aviation. The other part of the wider ARPA-E effort is included in a separate FOA targeting ultra-efficient and lightweight energy storage and fuel-to-electric power conversion system . The overarching goal of the two FOAs is to reduce the emissions from commercial aviation by developing cost-competitive systems for the efficient conversion of the chemical energy of carbon-neutral liquid fuels (CNLFs) to delivered electric energy, which is then further converted to thrust via propulsors driven by electric motors and associated motor drives. The focus of the ASCEND program is the development of an all-electric powertrain as the prime mover for long-range, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737. Current electric powertrains do not have high enough power density and efficiency to enable competitive and fully decarbonized aviation for the narrow-body class of aircraft. The ASCEND program aims to take advantage of emerging materials, manufacturing techniques, and design topologies, with a focus on the co-design of electromagnetics, power electronics, and thermal management solutions. The ASCEND program requires demanding figures of merit for specific power ( 12 kW/kg) and efficiency ( 93%) for the fully integrated all electric powertrain systems; these targets, among others, are well beyond the capability of current state of the-art technologies and will require creative thinking and innovation in the electric motor and power electronics space. The ASCEND program will incorporate two phases. Phase I calls for conceptual designs and computer simulations of motor, its drive, and their integration, as well as subsystem/component level demonstrations, as necessary, for the proposed key enabling technologies to support the design and simulated performance projections. Phase I will be 18 months long. Subject to the availability of appropriated funds, projects that achieve technical success in Phase I may, at ARPA-E’s sole discretion, proceed to the second phase of the program to develop, fabricate, and test an integrated motor and drive developmental prototype (≥ 250 kW) comprised of an electric motor, its drive and associated thermal management system (TMS). If successful, the ASCEND program will accelerate innovations and cause disruptive changes in the emerging electric aviation field, which is poised to play a significant role in the near- and long-term. The program will also further enhance the U.S. technology dominance in the field of high-performance electric motors for hybrid electric aviation and a full range of other industrial applications beyond aviation, such as electric vehicles, maritime technologies, wind turbines, and off-shore drilling.

The primary purpose of the program is to protect and preserve the rural heritage of the Cuyahoga Valley by adaptive reuse of historic farmsteads for farmers living on and actively farming the land. For the past 20 years, the NPS and the Recipient have worked collaboratively to bring active, sustainable, community-driven agriculture back into Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP) and the Northeast Ohio Region. This partnership helps educate and inspire visitors about the value of the rural landscape and how individuals can play a part in the preserving this vanishing resource, as well as providing access to healthy local food for the park, visitors, and surrounding communities. The project engages recipients, partners, communities, and/or visitors in shared environmentalstewardship. The project promotes greater public and private participation in historic preservation programs and activities. The project builds resource stewardship ethics in its participants. The information, products and/or services identified or developed by this project will be shared through a variety of strategies to increase public awareness, knowledge and support for historic preservation and stewardship of the nation’s cultural and historical heritage. The project motivates its youth participants to become involved in the natural, cultural and /or historical resource protection of their communities and beyond. Students gain “real world” or hands-on experience outside of the classroom of natural, cultural and/or historical resource projects. The project assists in the creation, promotion, facilitation, and/or improvement of the public’s understanding of natural, cultural, historic, recreational and other aspects of areas such as ecological conservation areas, and state and local parks. Recipient will employ multiple staff positions toward implementation and co-management of the CUVA Rural Landscape Program (Countryside Initiative [CI]) to achieve the following: 1) Advise NPS and farmers on agricultural best management practices for protection of natural and cultural resources. 2) Serve as core member the NPS farm management team to review and approval farm proposals and annual operating plans and assist in property inspections for maintenance needs.3) Provide guidance, training, equipment and other technical assistance resources to farmer lessees for sustaining their operations over the length of their leases, according to terms and conditions of their NPS leases. Address specific agricultural challenges farmers face in their operations.4) Serve as a community liaison among NPS, farmers, and the public regarding healthy local food systems, food access, and sustainable farming.

The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as amended by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution to develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have the clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability). Program Overview: ARPA-E seeks to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with commercial air travel at minimum economic cost by developing elements of an ultra-high efficient aircraft propulsion system that uses Carbon Neutral Liquid Fuels (CNLFs). Since these fuels generally either have lower specific-energies (kWh/kg) or are projected to have higher cost than traditional fossil-based jet fuels, ultra-high conversion efficiency is critical for the economic viability of this approach. An electrified propulsion system framework postulated by ARPA-E (Fig. 1) could potentially leverage multiple sources of stored energy (e.g. CNLF, batteries, etc.) to facilitate emerging propulsion concepts (e.g. distributed propulsion) and enable net-zero carbon emissions for long range, narrow-body, commercial aircraft. The objective of the Range Extenders for Electric Aviation with Low Carbon and High Efficiency (REEACH) program is the development of one element of the electrified propulsion system framework: a system for the conversion of chemical energy contained in energy dense CNLFs (green block in Fig. 1) to electric power for aircraft propulsion and hotel loads. (The development of the all-electric powertrain depicted in Fig. 1 is the objective of a separate ARPA-E FOA.)

The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as amended by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution to develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets.

SBIR/STTR Program Overview: The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are Government-wide programs authorized under Section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. § 638). The objectives of the SBIR program are to (1) stimulate technological innovation in the private sector, (2) strengthen the role of Small Business Concerns in meeting Federal R&D needs, (3) increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R&D activities, (4) foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned Small Business Concerns, and (5) improve the return on investment from Federally funded research and economic benefits to the Nation. The objective of the STTR program is to stimulate cooperative partnerships of ideas and technologies between Small Business Concerns and partnering Research Institutions through Federally funded R&D activities. ARPA-E administers a joint SBIR/STTR program in accordance with the Small Business Act and the SBIR and STTR Policy Directives issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). ARPA-E provides SBIR/STTR funding in three phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase IIS).

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358) to: “(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that result in— (i) reductions of imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reductions of energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; and (iii) improvement in the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.” ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under the programmatic authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as amended by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution to develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have the clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability). Program Overview: The Aviation-class Synergistically Cooled Electric-motors with iNtegrated Drives (ASCEND) program supports the development of novel lightweight and ultra-efficient electric motors, drives , and associated thermal management system (collectively referred to as the all-electric powertrain) that will facilitate net-zero carbon emissions in the single-aisle, 150-200 passenger commercial aircraft segment. This FOA represents part of a wider ARPA-E effort in the development of enabling technologies for long-range (≥ 2,800 nautical miles), carbon neutral commercial aviation. The other part of the wider ARPA-E effort is included in a separate FOA targeting ultra-efficient and lightweight energy storage and fuel-to-electric power conversion system . The overarching goal of the two FOAs is to reduce the emissions from commercial aviation by developing cost-competitive systems for the efficient conversion of the chemical energy of carbon-neutral liquid fuels (CNLFs) to delivered electric energy, which is then further converted to thrust via propulsors driven by electric motors and associated motor drives. The focus of the ASCEND program is the development of an all-electric powertrain as the prime mover for long-range, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737. Current electric powertrains do not have high enough power density and efficiency to enable competitive and fully decarbonized aviation for the narrow-body class of aircraft. The ASCEND program aims to take advantage of emerging materials, manufacturing techniques, and design topologies, with a focus on the co-design of electromagnetics, power electronics, and thermal management solutions. The ASCEND program requires demanding figures of merit for specific power ( 12 kW/kg) and efficiency ( 93%) for the fully integrated all electric powertrain systems; these targets, among others, are well beyond the capability of current state of the-art technologies and will require creative thinking and innovation in the electric motor and power electronics space. The ASCEND program will incorporate two phases. Phase I calls for conceptual designs and computer simulations of motor, its drive, and their integration, as well as subsystem/component level demonstrations, as necessary, for the proposed key enabling technologies to support the design and simulated performance projections. Phase I will be 18 months long. Subject to the availability of appropriated funds, projects that achieve technical success in Phase I may, at ARPA-E’s sole discretion, proceed to the second phase of the program to develop, fabricate, and test an integrated motor and drive developmental prototype (≥ 250 kW) comprised of an electric motor, its drive and associated thermal management system (TMS). If successful, the ASCEND program will accelerate innovations and cause disruptive changes in the emerging electric aviation field, which is poised to play a significant role in the near- and long-term. The program will also further enhance the U.S. technology dominance in the field of high-performance electric motors for hybrid electric aviation and a full range of other industrial applications beyond aviation, such as electric vehicles, maritime technologies, wind turbines, and off-shore drilling.

The mission of the ASLC is to generate scientific knowledge to promote understanding and stewardship of Alaska¿s marine ecosystems. The ASLC has the unique ability to bring science to life for students by sharing our research and knowledge through our education expertise. This project fits under the ASLC mission by sharing marine scientific lessons to promote student¿s understanding of marine ecosystems. Greater understanding of natural ecosystems contributes to greater stewardship in the long run, because students are considered future stewards of the resource. Staff members of the Alaska SeaLife Center have been successfully taking science to these students for the past ten years. Rural schools in Alaska are not connected to the road system and have very limited resources. Access is by small plane. Teachers are often expected to instruct multiple grade levels, and often must teach subjects in which they have little back ground to draw upon. Most often the subjects that suffer are Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). Students in these schools are predominantly Alaska Native, often with traditional lands and subsistence rights in nearby national parks. This program augments the science subjects available in rural schools which provides a service valued by Tribal partners, as well as strengthening the relationship between the NPS and long term resource stewards living and growing up in these villages. Rural schools in this program are in villages/local communities bordering Alaska parks. Frequently these villages are also the seat of Tribal governments with formal relationships with NPS. Education staff from the Alaska SeaLife Center will travel to off-the-road village schools to deliver K-12 science programs. Approximately 6 - 10 villages near Alaska parks and 1100 students will receive programs each school year. Education programming is a valued service in rural villages.

Purpose of Program: The purpose of the Fulbright-Hays GPA Program is to promote, improve, and develop the study of modern foreign languages and area studies at varying levels of education. The program provides opportunities for faculty, teachers, and undergraduate and graduate students to conduct individual and group projects overseas to carry out research and study in the fields of modern foreign languages and area studies. This competition invites applicants to submit an application to request support for either a Fulbright-Hays GPA short-term project (GPA short-term projects 84.021A) or a Fulbright-Hays GPA long-term project (GPA long-term projects 84.021B). Applicants must clearly indicate on the SF 424, the Application for Federal Assistance cover sheet whether they are applying for support for a GPA short-term project (84.021A) or a GPA long-term project (84.021B). Additional submission details are included in the application package. There are three types of GPA short-term projects: (1) Short-term seminar projects of four to six weeks in length designed to help integrate international studies into an institution's or school system's general curriculum by focusing on a particular aspect of area study, such as the culture of an area or country of study (34 CFR 664.11); (2) curriculum development projects of four to eight weeks in length that provide participants an opportunity to acquire resource materials for curriculum development in modern foreign language and area studies for use and dissemination in the United States (34 CFR 664.12); and (3) group research or study projects of three to twelve months in duration designed to give participants the opportunity to undertake research or study in a foreign country (34 CFR 664.13). GPA long-term projects are advanced overseas intensive language projects that may be carried out during a full year, an academic year, a semester, a trimester, a quarter, or a summer. GPA long-term projects are designed to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the foreign country for intensive advanced language training and for using the language while experiencing the culture in the foreign country. Participants should have successfully completed at least two academic years of training in the language to be studied to be eligible to participate in a GPA intensive advanced language training program. In addition, the language to be studied must be indigenous to the host country and maximum use must be made of local institutions and personnel (34 CFR 664.14).

By combining genetic and non-invasive approaches in the field and molecular markers in the laboratory, we will be able to collect sufficient samples to answer fundamental questions of marten and fox ecology and their response to repatriating wolves to Isle Royale. Specific objectives include: 1) Analyze multi-locus genetic data that has already been collected over two field seasons from marten and fox scat samples to estimate abundance, recruitment, and survivorship of foxes and martens via genetic mark-recapture analyses. 2) Quantify diet of martens and foxes from previously collected hair samples for the analysis of stable isotopes to determine marten and fox proportional dietary inputs before and after wolf repatriation and pack coalescence. Analyze camera trap data to explore carrion use and foraging behavior of mesocarnviores. 3) Use documented presences of martens and foxes to develop multi-species and -season occupancy models to explore site-specific occupancy, local extinction and colonization and develop structural equation models to estimate the effect of wolf repatriation on the two other dominant carnivores of the island. 4) Collect a third year of data – scat samples (for genetics) and occupancy models to effectively analyze these data in a robust design framework (3 years of sampling needed to fulfill the robust design framework identified in objectives 1 & 4)."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Women and Minorities in STEM Fields","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323150","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>USDA-NIFA-WAMS-007011</b>","contentSnippet":"USDA-NIFA-WAMS-007011","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323150","categories":["AG|Agriculture"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323150"},{"opportunity-number":"USDA-NIFA-WAMS-007011"},{"opportunity-title":"Women and Minorities in STEM Fields"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Agriculture"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"10.318"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"As contained in Section 7204 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (FCEA) (Pub.L. 110-246 which amends Section 1672 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5925)), applications may only be submitted by the following eligible applicants: (a) State agricultural experiment stations; (b) colleges and universities; (c) university research foundations; (d) other research institutions and organizations; (e) Federal agencies; (f) national laboratories; (g) private organizations or corporations; and, (h) individuals."},{"agency-code":"USDA-NIFA"},{"agency-name":"Department of AgricultureNational Institute of Food and Agriculture"},{"posted-date":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"close-date":"Feb 24, 2020 FY 2020 February 24, 2020FY 2021 January 21, 2021"},{"last-updated-date":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"award-ceiling":"$0"},{"award-floor":"$0"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":"$400,000"},{"expected-number-of-awards":""},{"description":"The purpose of this program is to support research, education/teaching, and extension projects that increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in STEM.

The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as amended by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. Program Overview: U.S. agriculture has the potential to produce ~5 Quadrillion Btu of energy in the form of biofuels, and with new innovations throughout the biofuel supply chain, these fuels could become carbon negative. Reaching this potential and achieving greater carbon reductions requires that feedstock producers adopt new technologies and management practices that simultaneously improve yield, drive down production associated emissions, and enhance carbon sequestration in soils. To facilitate the adoption of these new technologies and practices for improved carbon management, feedstock producers need incentives beyond yield. While carbon management incentive structures exist elsewhere in the biofuel supply chain, they do not extend to feedstock production because monitoring and verification of feedstock production emissions is too costly to conduct at the field level. Instead, all feedstock producers are assumed to produce the same amount of emissions— the national average —despite significant variations in actual emissions when moving to state or regional averages, let alone field-level estimates. The objective of the Systems for Monitoring and Analytics for Renewable Transportation Fuels from Agricultural Resources and Management (SMARTFARM) program is to bridge the data gap in the biofuel supply chain by funding the development of technologies that can replace national averages and emissions factors for feedstock-related emissions with field-level estimates.

The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as amended by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. Program Overview: U.S. agriculture has the potential to produce ~5 Quadrillion Btu of energy in the form of biofuels, and with new innovations throughout the biofuel supply chain, these fuels could become carbon negative. Reaching this potential and achieving greater carbon reductions requires that feedstock producers adopt new technologies and management practices that simultaneously improve yield, drive down production associated emissions, and enhance carbon sequestration in soils. To facilitate the adoption of these new technologies and practices for improved carbon management, feedstock producers need incentives beyond yield. While carbon management incentive structures exist elsewhere in the biofuel supply chain, they do not extend to feedstock production because monitoring and verification of feedstock production emissions is too costly to conduct at the field level. Instead, all feedstock producers are assumed to produce the same amount of emissions— the national average —despite significant variations in actual emissions when moving to state or regional averages, let alone field-level estimates. The objective of the Systems for Monitoring and Analytics for Renewable Transportation Fuels from Agricultural Resources and Management (SMARTFARM) program is to bridge the data gap in the biofuel supply chain by funding the development of technologies that can replace national averages and emissions factors for feedstock-related emissions with field-level estimates. The value of such technologies will be evaluated by their ability to reliably, accurately (i.e. low uncertainty), and cost-effectively quantify feedstock production lifecycle emissions (in g CO2e/acre) at the field level (i.e. scalable to >80 acres). If successful, the technologies funded by this phase of the SMARTFARM program will catalyze new market incentives for efficiency in feedstock production and carbon management, reducing annual U.S. emissions by ~1%, and with substantially greater potential emissions reductions implications if expanded to other agricultural products beyond biofuels."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Scaling Capacity in Strategic and Health Information Systems in Mozambique under the President&apos;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=320102","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>CDC-RFA-GH20-2057</b>","contentSnippet":"CDC-RFA-GH20-2057","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=320102","categories":["HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"320102"},{"opportunity-number":"CDC-RFA-GH20-2057"},{"opportunity-title":"Scaling Capacity in Strategic and Health Information Systems in Mozambique under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Health"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.067"},{"eligible-applicants":"Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":""},{"agency-code":"HHS-CDC-CGH"},{"agency-name":"Department of Health and Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control - CGH"},{"posted-date":"Jan 17, 2020"},{"close-date":"Mar 17, 2020 Electronically submitted applications must be submitted no later than 11:59 p.m., ET, on the listed application due date."},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 17, 2020"},{"award-ceiling":"$0"},{"award-floor":"$0"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":"$0"},{"expected-number-of-awards":"3"},{"description":"The Award Ceiling for Year 1 is 0 (none).

For locally acting drug products, where conventional BE approaches are infeasible, the FDA has been researching the feasibility of alternative, scientifically valid methods, including modeling approaches, to support an evaluation of BE.Ophthalmic drugs are locally acting and may give rise to challenges in measuring detectable drug levels. To establish BE of ophthalmic drug products, a comparative clinical endpoint BE study is generally utilized as a surrogate for drug concentration at the site of action, as such measurements in local eye tissues are often impractical, unethical and cost-prohibitive. Modeling and simulation can be a powerful tool to predict local drug concentrations in eye tissues based on data from in vitro, animal, and human studies. Specifically, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling may integrate information about the drug product properties and ocular physiology to predict the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in humans, allowing clinical relevance determination of critical drug product attributes for BE assessment. To advance FDA's mission to make high quality, safe, and effective drug products available to the American public while supporting innovation, it is essential to explore the potential utility of novel, efficient standards for BE that may be applicable to prospective generic drug products. To support this goal, the Agency seeks to investigate the qualitative and functional characteristics of different ophthalmic formulations and to understand when differences in product quality attributes may be clinically meaningful, by utilizing modeling and simulation approaches.ObjectiveThe objective of this work is to support research relevant to ophthalmic drug products that will help extrapolate animal models to human ophthalmic PK and PD models. The purpose is to systematically evaluate the current animal and human ophthalmic PK and PD models available, with a focus on extrapolation from existing animal models to human models.Upon the successful completion of this research, we would expect to have a better understanding of the current existing knowledge gaps and potential solutions for the human PK/PD model extrapolation from animal models.Detailed DescriptionPreclinical studies are very useful to understand drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). The rabbit is commonly used in ophthalmic drug development due to the similarity in anatomy and physiology between rabbit and human eyes. Drug concentrations in rabbit local eye tissues, such as aqueous humor, iris ciliary body, cornea and conjunctiva, can be measured. This in vitro and animal data can be used to develop PK and PD models that can be further verified and validated using additional animal data during the rabbit model development.Human PBPK/PD models can be extrapolated from validated animal models by considering the anatomy and physiology differences between rabbit and human eyes. However, one of the major challenges is the validation of the extrapolated PK and PD models because human data are sparsely available. The measurement of drug in most ocular tissues is infeasible in clinical studies. Drug concentrations may be measured in aqueous humor but obtaining samples can only be justified during cataract surgery for cataract patients only. For PD measurement, intra-ocular pressure (IOP) currently remains to be the only known modifiable risk factor for open-angle glaucoma. Measurement of IOP reduction has been used in preclinical and clinical settings to evaluate the efficacy for anti-glaucoma drug products.This research would aim to systematically evaluate the current animal and human ophthalmic PK and PD models available, with a focus on the extrapolation from existing animal models to human PK and PD models, validating the human model, and understanding knowledge gaps and potential solutions for successful model extrapolation.Specific aims include:1. Develop a comprehensive report detailing the rabbit ophthalmic PK and PD models and pre-clinical data available.2. Develop a comprehensive report detailing the human ophthalmic PK and PD models and the related clinical data available.3. Extrapolate rabbit PK and PD models in Aim 1 to human PBPK/PD models by considering the anatomy and physiology differences between rabbits and human beings.4.

This means that 94% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) know their status as HIV positive. Among those who know their positive status, 96% are actively on anti-retroviral treatment (ART), and among those on ART, 95% are virally suppressed. This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is designed to strengthen the Namibian HIV program to achieve sustained epidemic control. This mechanism provides high quality technical assistance (TA) to strengthen health information systems (HIS); support surveys, surveillance, and routine program monitoring; and strengthen case-based surveillance (CBS) through strategies including improved interoperability of data systems and the establishment and implementation of unique patient identifiers in Namibia to facilitate data integration in strengthening public health programs for sustained epidemic control. The strategy is grounded in setting the stage for long-term transition to full Namibia domestic leadership and, in the short term, continuing to strengthen the broader health system interventions. The result of this work will be a stronger and more flexible, data-driven response that will allow Namibia to reach epidemic control in a sustainable manner."},{"version":"3"},{"modification-comments":"archive 30 days after close"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Revision Applications for Incorporation of Novel NCI-Supported Technology to Accelerate Cancer Research (U54 Clinical Trial Optional)","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323221","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>RFA-CA-20-023</b>","contentSnippet":"RFA-CA-20-023","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323221","categories":["ED|Education","HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323221"},{"opportunity-number":"RFA-CA-20-023"},{"opportunity-title":"Revision Applications for Incorporation of Novel NCI-Supported Technology to Accelerate Cancer Research (U54 Clinical Trial Optional)"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"EducationHealth"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.394"},{"eligible-applicants":"State governmentsCounty governmentsCity or township governmentsSpecial district governmentsIndependent school districtsPublic and State controlled institutions of higher educationNative American tribal governments (Federally recognized)Public housing authorities/Indian housing authoritiesNative American tribal organizations (other than Federally recognized tribal governments)Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationFor profit organizations other than small businessesSmall businessesOthers (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Other Eligible Applicants include the following:  Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISISs); Eligible Agencies of the Federal Government; Faith-based or Community-based Organizations; Hispanic-serving Institutions; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); Indian/Native American Tribal Governments (Other than Federally Recognized); Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Organizations); Regional Organizations; Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) ; U.S. Territory or Possession; Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are not eligible to apply.

The critical components of this award mechanism are:  Impact: Research supported by the Breakthrough Award will have the potential for a major impact and accelerate progress toward ending breast cancer. The impact may be near-term or long-term, but must move beyond a minor advancement and have the potential to lead to a new approach that is fundamentally better than interventions already approved or in clinical development. Applications are expected to identify the breast cancer patients or at-risk individuals who would ultimately benefit from the proposed research.   Research Scope: The Breakthrough Award is structured with four different funding levels. The levels are designed to support major (but not all) stages of research that will lead to clinical application. Each level has a defined research scope. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (PI) to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The funding level should be selected based on the research scope defined in the Program Announcement, and not on the amount of the budget. The Government reserves the right to fund an application at a lower funding level.  The current Program Announcement discusses the Breakthrough Award Levels 1 and 2. Funding Levels 3 and 4 are available under other Program Announcements (W81XWH-20- BCRP-BTA3 and W81XWH-20-BCRP-BTA4, respectively). The PI is strongly encouraged to review the research scope defined under each funding level as described in the corresponding Breakthrough Award Program Announcement before submitting the pre-application.  The following are general descriptions, although not all-inclusive, of the scope of research projects that would be appropriate to propose under the current Program Announcement:   Funding Level 1: Innovative, high-risk/high-reward research that is in the earliest stages of idea development or is an untested theory that addresses an important problem. To foster research that yields new avenues of investigation, preliminary data are not required. Proof of concept is the anticipated outcome. Funding Level 2: Preclinical research that is already supported by substantial preliminary or published data and strongly validates clinical translation in a well-defined context within the breast cancer landscape. Funding Level 2: Population Science and Prevention Studies: Preclinical research that is already supported by substantial preliminary or published data and strongly validates clinical translation in a well-defined context within the breast cancer landscape. With compelling justification, population science and prevention studies may request higher levels of funding and an additional year in the period of performance. Such studies may require additional resources due to the participation of human subjects and/or use of human biospecimens.   Partnering PI Option: The Breakthrough Award encourages applications that include meaningful and productive collaborations between investigators. The Partnering PI Option is structured to accommodate two PIs. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI will be identified as a Partnering PI. Initiating and Partnering PIs each have different submission requirements, as described in Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission; however, both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization. The PIs may have expertise in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application.  New collaborations are encouraged, but not required. The application is expected to describe how the PIs’ combined expertise will better address the research question and explain why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. To meet the intent of the Partnering PI Option, applicants are discouraged from being named as a Partnering PI on multiple Breakthrough Award Levels 1 and 2 applications unless they are clearly addressing distinct research questions. Applications in which a mentor and their current postdoctoral fellow or junior investigator are named as Initiating and Partnering PIs do not meet the intent of the Partnering PI Option.

The application is expected to describe how the PIs’ combined expertise will better address the research question and explain why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. To meet the intent of the Partnering PI Option, applicants are discouraged from being named as a Partnering PI on multiple Breakthrough Award Level 3 applications unless they are clearly addressing distinct research questions.  Personnel: Applications are expected to include an appropriate and robust research team with the combined backgrounds and breast cancer-related expertise to enable successful conduct of the project.  Consumer Advocates: Applications are required to include consumer advocate involvement. The research team must include two or more breast cancer consumer advocates, who will be integral throughout the planning and implementation of the research project. Consumer advocates should be involved in the development of the research question, project design, oversight, recruitment, and evaluation, as well as other significant aspects of the proposed project. Interactions with other team members should be well integrated and ongoing, not limited to attending seminars and semi-annual meetings. As lay representatives, the consumer advocates must be individuals who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, and they should be active in a breast cancer advocacy organization. Their role in the project should be independent of their employment, and they cannot be employees of any of the organizations participating in the application.

The critical components of this award mechanism are:  Impact: Research supported by the Breakthrough Award will have the potential for a major impact and accelerate progress toward ending breast cancer. The impact may be near-term or long-term, but must move beyond a minor advancement and have the potential to lead to a new approach that is fundamentally better than interventions already approved or in clinical development. Applications are expected to identify the breast cancer patients or at-risk individuals who would ultimately benefit from the proposed research.   Research Scope: The Breakthrough Award is structured with four different funding levels. The levels are designed to support major (but not all) stages of research that will lead to clinical application. Each level has a defined research scope. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (PI) to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The funding level should be selected based on the research scope defined in the Program Announcement, and not on the amount of the budget. An application that does not meet the intent of the funding level selected will not be recommended for funding, even if it might meet the intent of a different funding level.   The current Program Announcement discusses the Breakthrough Award Level 4. Funding Levels 1, 2, and 3 are available under other Program Announcements (W81XWH-20-BCRP- BTA12 for Levels 1 and 2 and W81XWH-20-BCRP-BTA3 for Level 3). The PI is strongly encouraged to review the research scope defined under each funding level as described in the corresponding Breakthrough Award Program Announcements before submitting the pre- application.  The following is a general description, although not all-inclusive, of the scope of research projects that would be appropriate to propose under the current Program Announcement:   Funding Level 4: Large-scale projects that will transform and revolutionize the clinical management and/or prevention of breast cancer. Human clinical trials are required. PIs are expected to have experience in successfully leading large-scale projects and demonstrated ability (through personal experience or via a commitment from a collaborating clinical investigator) to implement a clinical project successfully. Where relevant, applications must demonstrate availability of and access to necessary data, human samples, cohort(s), and/or critical reagents. For proposed research that will require U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) involvement, project readiness requirements at the time of application submission include: proof of availability of and access to clinical reagents (e.g., therapeutics) that meet regulatory compliance guidelines, proof of availability of and access to appropriate subject population(s), validated projections for patient recruitment, and submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to the FDA, if applicable.   Recruitment Milestones: The application must indicate the quarterly enrollment targets across all sites in Attachment 4: Statement of Work (SOW). Successful applicants will work with USAMRAA to establish milestones for human subject recruitment. Continued support for the project will be based upon satisfactory progress in meeting the established milestones.   Partnering PI Option: The Breakthrough Award encourages applications that include meaningful and productive collaborations between investigators. The Partnering PI Option is structured to accommodate two PIs. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI will be identified as a Partnering PI. Initiating and Partnering PIs each have different submission requirements, as described in Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission; however, both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project including the Project Narrative, SOW, and other required components. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization. The PIs may have expertise in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application. New collaborations are encouraged, but not required. The application is expected to describe how the PIs’ combined expertise will better address the research question and explain why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. To meet the intent of the Partnering PI Option, applicants are discouraged from being named as a Partnering PI on multiple Breakthrough Award Level 4 applications unless they are clearly addressing distinct research questions.   Personnel: Applications are expected to include an appropriate and robust research team with the combined backgrounds and breast cancer-related expertise to enable successful conduct of the project.   Consumer Advocates: Applications are required to include consumer advocate involvement. The research team must include two or more breast cancer consumer advocates, who will be integral throughout the planning and implementation of the research project. Consumer advocates should be involved in the development of the research question, project design, oversight, recruitment, and evaluation, as well as other significant aspects of the proposed project. Interactions with other team members should be well integrated and ongoing, not limited to attending seminars and semi-annual meetings.

Communities often act as gateways for invasive pests and disease, and well managed community forests, especially when a part of shared stewardship across the landscape, can slow or even halt the spread before they infect neighboring private, state or National forests. Our forests are also under threat from natural disasters including wildland fires, hurricanes, tornados, flooding and landslides. Well managed forests are better prepared to withstand these threats, protecting lives, infrastructure, homes, habitats, water quality, economies, and social health and well-being.  To better equip our communities in preventing and responding to these threats, the U&CF program requests innovative proposals that strengthen urban and community forest resiliency and align with the goals in the National Ten Year Urban and Community Forestry Action Plan (2016-2026). Collaborative solutions may include but are not limited to: research; prevention; planning; policy; preparedness; implementation; best management practices; recovery; and reforestation that promotes the resilience of our Nation’s urban & community forests.   Urban and Community Forestry Program Requirements Innovative Forest Resiliency proposals shall have national or multi-state application and impact. A proposal’s content must meet the Urban and Community Forestry program authorities as designated by Congress in the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act, (Section 9 PDF, pp. 19-24) State & Private Cooperative Forestry Handbook of Programs and one or more of the goals in the National Ten Year Urban and Community Forestry Action Plan (2016-2026)   Available Funding: The U.S. Forest Service anticipates that the statutory authority (Sub Title 9 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act) for the Fiscal Year 2020 Urban and Community Forestry (U&CF) Program may provide, approximately $900,000 in grant funds to be awarded through the 2020 National Urban and Community Forestry Grant Program. Funds are to support national urban and community forestry projects on nonfederal public land that have a national or multi-state impact and application.

To this end, systems are increasingly being implemented by composingheterogeneous computing componentsand continually changing memory systems as novel, performant hardware surfaces. Applications fueled by rapid stridesin machine learning, data analysis, and extreme-scale simulation are becoming more domain-specific and highly distributed. In this scenario, traditional boundaries between hardware-oriented and software-oriented disciplines increasingly are blurred. Achieving scalability of systems and applications will therefore require coordinated progress in multiple disciplines such ascomputer architecture, high-performance computing (HPC), programming languages and compilers, security and privacy, systems, theory, and algorithms.Cross-cutting concernssuch as performance (including, but not limited to, time, space, and communication resource usage and energy efficiency), correctness and accuracy (including, but not limited to, emerging techniques for program analysis, testing, debugging, probabilistic reasoning and inference, and verification), security and privacy, robustness and reliability,domain-specific design, and heterogeneity must be taken into account from the outset in all aspects of systems and application design and implementation. The aim of the Principles and Practice of Scalable Systems (PPoSS) program is to support a community of researchers who will work symbiotically across the multiple disciplines above to perform basic research on scalability of modern applications, systems, and toolchains. The intent is that these efforts will foster the development of principles that lead to rigorous and reproducible artifacts for the design and implementation of large-scale systems and applications across the full hardware/software stack. These principles and methodologies should simultaneously provide guarantees on correctness and accuracy, robustness, and security and privacy of systems, applications, and toolchains.Importantly, as described below,PPoSS specifically seeks to fund projects that span the entire hardware/software stackand will lay the groundwork for sustainable approaches for engineering highly performant, scalable, and robust computing applications."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"FY2020 Title X Services Grants: Providing Publicly-Funded Family Planning Services in Areas of High Need","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323353","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>PA-FPH-20-001</b>","contentSnippet":"PA-FPH-20-001","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323353","categories":["HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"opportunity-id":"323353"},{"opportunity-number":"PA-FPH-20-001"},{"opportunity-title":"FY2020 Title X Services Grants: Providing Publicly-Funded Family Planning Services in Areas of High Need"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Health"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.217"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Any public or private nonprofit entity located in a State (which includes one of the 50 United States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Republic of Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands) is eligible to apply for a grant under this announcement.

Diseases of significant concern include Lyme disease, malaria, dengue virus and other arboviruses. The program supports development of: (1) new toxicants orthe adaptation of existing toxicants to relevant vectors; (2) new insecticide application techniques; and (3) new personal protection tools that prevent human-vector contact. Ideally the research would support the Advanced Technology Development (i.e. DoD RDT&E “Budget Activity 3” in theDoD Financial Management Regulation Volume 2B, Chapter 5) of new insecticides, or improved formulations of existing insecticides for vector control, new technology or enhanced modalities of personal protection from biting arthropods, or improved efficacy and sustainability of equipment for application of pesticides for vector control in a military operational environment. Research should be product-oriented, consisting of advanced research related to a particular technology or new capability, field evaluation of products for military uses, or research directed towards the development of an existing prototype product for commercial manufacture. Research should include the semi-field or field evaluation of prototype products. Research should not include testing and evaluation of commercial products or modifying commercial products for a new use. Any pesticides described in proposed research should be registered with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or EPA registration must be intended for pesticides without current EPA registration. The research must be primarily applicable to the military, and products should be transferable to civilian uses.Up to $4,500,000 may be awarded in FY20, with future years subject to the availability of funds. The total proposed cost cannot exceed $300,000 per year for up to 3 years (total project maximum $900,000), inclusive of all direct and indirect costs. Funding is intended to be provided in July 2020. Projects will be selected on the basis of peer-reviewed scientific merit and programmatic relevance determined by a technical committee representing the Armed Forces Pest Management Board and Service components.Pre-proposals were accepted from investigators who are employed by or affiliated with an eligible institution. Eligible institutions include for-profit, non-profit, public, and private organizations in any country. Examples include universities, hospitals, laboratories, companies, and agencies of local, state government. Federal Agencies may also respond to this request; however, federal requests will be processed in accordance with applicable regulations.The estimated timeline for the FY20 DWFP Program is as follows:• November 25, 2019: Deadline for pre-proposals (Completed)• Approx. January 8, 2020: Invitation to submit full proposals (Completed)• Approx. February 25, 2020: Deadline for full proposals• Approx.

Coexistence is when two or more applications use the same frequency band at the same time and/or at the same location, yet do not adversely affect one another. Coexistence is especially difficult when at least one of the spectrum users is passive, i.e., not transmitting any radio frequency (RF) energy. Examples of coexisting systems may include passive and active systems (e.g., radio astronomy and 5G wireless communication systems) or two active systems (e.g., weather radar and Wi-Fi). Breakthrough innovations are sought on both the wireless communication hardware and the algorithmic/protocol fronts through synergistic teamwork. The goal of these research projects may be the creation of new technology or significant enhancements to existing wireless infrastructure, with an aim to benefit society by improving spectrum utilization, beyond mere spectrum efficiency. The SWIFT program seeks to fund collaborative team research that transcends the traditional boundaries of individual disciplines.

See the full posting on NSPIRES for details.  ﻿The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2019 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on March 14, 2019. In this case \"omnibus\" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2019 solicitation, and the \"Summary of Solicitation\" as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019.   This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under \"Announcement Documents\" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH19ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF) to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF). While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the overview.    Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2019 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

The GDUFA research program supports the development of new tools for FDA to evaluate generic drug equivalence and for industry to efficiently develop new generic products. In the re-authorization of GDUFA in 2017 (GDUFA II), FDA made a commitment to assist industry in the submission of an ANDA for a complex drug product by making improvements in the process for development of product-specific guidances and conduct of pre-ANDA meetings for complex products. As described in the GDUFA II Commitment Letter (https://www.fda.gov/media/101052/download ), complex products generally consist of: (1) products with complex active ingredients, complex formulations, complex routes of delivery, or complex dosage forms, (2) complex drug-device combination products, and (3) other products where complexity or uncertainty concerning the approval pathway or possible alternative approach would benefit from early scientific engagement. The development of guidances and recommendations (communicated through product-specific guidances and pre-ANDA meetings) require FDA to continually improve a strong scientific research program related to complex generic drug products. Each year, OGD posts research priorities for generic drugs on its webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/generic-drugs/generic-drugs-priorities-projects. As yearly research priorities for generic drugs are identified, FDA recognizes the need for improved collaborations with the generic industry to successfully address scientific gaps that may present barriers to generic product development and/or ANDA review. Therefore, the FDA is announcing this FOA to establish a Center for Research on Complex Generics with the goals of providing the following: (1) facilitation of engagement with generic industry to encourage participation in complex generics research, (2) coordination of research projects pertaining to complex generics with the generic drug industry, and (3) coordination of training, workshops, and other educational activities pertaining to complex generic drug research. These efforts will enable FDA to establish enhanced research collaborations with the generic industry to further the FDA's mission of increasing access to safe and effective generic drugs. This new center will complement FDA's existing regulatory science programs through its specific focus as a hub for coordination and engagement with the generic industry. Program Characteristics 1.Collaborative interactions to stimulate generic drug research engagement from the generic drug industry and accelerate progress in areas of high priority to OGD and the generic drug industry. Collaborative interactions may include:  Scientific exchanges such as a visiting scientist program. FDA staff may visit the Center or a partner site to provide lectures and/or participate in workshops, spend time learning about new technologies or how to use new instrumentation and meet with program directors and interested scientific staff. Reciprocally, Center members may visit FDA to provide lectures and/or participate in workshops, visit FDA laboratories, and meet with FDA staff. These discussions may foster new collaborations/interactions with Center members and FDA. Industry scientists also may visit the Center to learn about new technology and aid the Center in developing research proposals that address scientific challenges in the generic drug industry. Such visits will be conducted consistent with all applicable laws, regulations and policies, to minimize conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest. In addition, any non-public information may only be shared as authorized by law and regulation. Workshops on generic drug research. These workshops should engage FDA, the Center and its members, the generic drug industry and the public. These workshops may be co-sponsored with the FDA, consistent with applicable policies regarding co-sponsorships. Scientific and educational workshops in partnership with FDA may be proposed for horizon scanning for emerging fields or trends in generic drug research to bring relevant stakeholders together and to accelerate understanding of different fields.  Applicants need to demonstrate their ability to accomplish the collaborative interactions described above, as well as propose other types of interactions that would further engagement with the public, in particular, with the generic industry. 2. Infrastructure to support core program for the Center. Applicants must describe the proposed organizational structure to establish and support collaborations with other entities and individual investigators.  3. Cutting-edge scientific research in analytical methods, modeling and simulation, formulation science, clinical and pre-clinical development, and other areas pertaining to generic drug research. Applicants must demonstrate partnerships with scientific investigators who have expertise in these areas and understand the goals of the generic drug research program. Applicants should also demonstrate the ability to engage effectively with the generic drug industry. As noted on page 16, below, when research resources have been developed with FDA funds and the associated research findings published, those findings must be made readily available to the scientific community."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"RFI - Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement (REPAIR)","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323501","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>DE-FOA-0002263</b>","contentSnippet":"DE-FOA-0002263","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323501","categories":["ST|Science and Technology and other Research and Development"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323501"},{"opportunity-number":"DE-FOA-0002263"},{"opportunity-title":"RFI - Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement (REPAIR)"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative AgreementGrant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Science and Technology and other Research and Development"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"81.135"},{"eligible-applicants":"Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"This is a Request for Information only.

The specific objective of the Children’s Healthy Weight State Capacity Building Program is to develop three state models in MCH nutrition integration, which can then be implemented and replicated in states nationwide. These state models will focus on (1) increasing the MCH nutrition competency of the state Title V workforce and (2) optimizing MCH nutrition-related data sources to contribute to data-driven programs and activities related to assessment, policy development, and assurance. The state models will increase access to high-quality, evidence-based nutrition services for MCH populations, including all women of childbearing age and their children, using innovative strategies to build state capacity to integrate nutrition statewide into Title V programs. This program will support states to strengthen, align, and coordinate current nutrition programs, services, and resources in order to build and expand capacity around MCH nutrition. The Children’s Healthy Weight State Capacity Building Program will build on lessons learned from, and formative work currently underway in, the Children’s Healthy Weight CoIIN (CHW-CoIIN) to support states in developing and/or increasing capacity to improve the nutritional status of MCH populations across the lifespan. The program will increase partnerships and collaboration across MCH agencies to support nutrition integration into Title V programs and increase awareness of the importance of coordinated statewide MCH nutrition services. HRSA will award one cooperative agreement to a recipient to develop three state models in MCH nutrition integration. The recipient will identify the three states to develop in to state models; states will be selected based on readiness and documented support for nutrition integration activities, such as a statewide MCH nutrition needs assessment. The recipient will provide direct financial support to the three states for development of state models, engaging in joint planning with key stakeholders to determine assets, set priorities, share resources, and implement innovative activities. The recipient will build state capacity around MCH nutrition by coordinating and providing MCH nutrition leadership, intensive state-specific technical assistance (TA) related to the integration of MCH nutrition across Title V programs (e.g., innovative implementation strategies, data integration, collaborative learning), and facilitating collaborative activities across state MCH agencies.

The purpose of this program is to establish and maintain an interdisciplinary, national, multi-center practice-based research forum for scientific collaboration and infrastructure building. The PRC-RN will provide national leadership to advance the evidence base on effective interventions1 that address maternal health including, but not limited to, pregnancy, pre-conception care, inter-conception care, maternal morbidity, maternal mortality, and current and emerging issues and gaps in research and practice, such as models of delivery of pregnancy-related care in settings with limited resources in the United States. The PRC-RN will: • Lead, promote, and coordinate national research activities to improve pregnancy-related health care and maternal health, especially addressing barriers to access quality services for underserved populations; • Develop and maintain an infrastructure to support a portfolio of multi-site, interdisciplinary research focused on fostering the implementation of multi-site intervention research studies, translating of research to policy and practice, and providing a mentoring environment to train a new generation of clinical and non-clinical researchers in applied and translational pregnancy-related research; and • Address, where applicable, the following U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) priority areas namely, mental health, opioid use disorder, prescription drug pricing, maternal mortality, and telehealth. • Indicate how study findings will further develop the evidence base, where relevant for this program. The recipient of the cooperative agreement is encouraged to leverage existing work in the field, as appropriate, and extend the impact of HRSA’s existing programs and resources in the areas of maternal and women’s health. For example, the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) assists state-based teams with the implementation of maternal safety bundles. Safety bundles are small, straightforward sets of evidence-based practices, that, when performed collectively and reliably, have been shown to improve patient outcomes. These bundles improve the quality and safety of maternity care with the goal of reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. As of August 2019, there are 27 states enrolled in AIM and approximately 1,300 hospitals participating in bundle implementation. Additional information about other HRSA programs on maternal and women’s health can be read at: https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-topics/maternal-and-womens-health.

In regulating the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector, new technologies can improve drug quality, address shortages of medicines, and lower drug costs. To help achieve this, FDA encourages development and adoption of emerging manufacturing technology to modernize pharmaceutical manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing holds great promise for improving the American market for drugs and biologicals and, results in a more robust manufacturing process with fewer interruptions in production, fewer product failures (before or after distribution), and greater assurance that the drug products manufactured in any given period of time will provide the expected clinical performance. In other words, encouraging the development and adoption of emerging manufacturing technologies may lead to improved manufacturing, and therefore improved product quality and availability throughout a product’s lifecycle.The complexity of drug products has been increasing over the years, in part due to, the increasing number of poorly soluble drugs, targeted drug delivery to traditionally un-druggable sites, and increasing focus on personalized and precision medicine. In the realm of drug products, complexity may arise from the active ingredient, the formulation, the dosage form, etc. In order to prepare for the increase in complex products, the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality is considering best practices and paths forward in the risk-based quality assessment of complex drug products. While the development of emerging technology is critical to modernizing pharmaceutical manufacturing and improving quality, FDA also recognizes that the implementation of emerging technology could present challenges to both industry and FDA. By the very nature of an approach being new or innovative in pharmaceutical industry, a limited knowledge and experiential base about the technology may exist. This program aims to address knowledge and experience gaps identified for emerging manufacturing technology and support the development and adoption of such technology in the pharmaceutical sector.Project ObjectivesThe goal of this program is to support the advancement of regulatory science that can (1) facilitate the implementation and the assessment of emerging manufacturing technology in the pharmaceutical sector; (2) expand the knowledge base related to complex products and formulation development, analysis, and manufacturing control to advance risk-based quality assessment of new and generic drug productsIdentified emerging technologies should be sufficiently developed and likely ready for industrial implementation for the purpose of product quality enhancement. The results and knowledge developed in this program can be utilized by industry, academia, and industry to support the implementation of the identified emerging technologies and to ensure that FDA regulatory policies reflect state-of-the-art manufacturing science. Specifically, the expected project outcomes should enable (1) developing tools and approaches for risk-based quality assessment, (2) establishing science-based quality standards and policies, and/or (3) providing training tools for both the industry and/or the regulatory bodies for the identified emerging technology.Potential research projects could include those that focus on characterizing complex drug substances (including botanical drug substances) and complex drug product dosage forms. Projects could include related control strategies to ensure the product quality, especially those which can help solve potential regulatory questions related to drug quality. Specific topics could relate to the following:1. Appropriate analytical methods for complex drug substances or products2. In-process controls during manufacturing processes to ensure product quality3. Raw material quality controlNOTE: Proposals should clearly describe the potential impacts of the proposed technology on readiness for broad implementation in pharmaceutical industry, control strategy, and/or regulatory evaluation for complex drug substances and complex drug product dosage forms."},{"version":"2"},{"modification-comments":"Close Date Explanation"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"2020 Olympics Programming","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323533","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>PAS-SINGAPORE-FY20-002</b>","contentSnippet":"PAS-SINGAPORE-FY20-002","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323533","categories":["CD|Community Development","ED|Education","HU|Humanities (see \"Cultural Affairs\" in CFDA)"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323533"},{"opportunity-number":"PAS-SINGAPORE-FY20-002"},{"opportunity-title":"2020 Olympics Programming"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Community DevelopmentEducationHumanities (see \"Cultural Affairs\" in CFDA)"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"19.040"},{"eligible-applicants":"State governmentsCounty governmentsCity or township governmentsSpecial district governmentsIndependent school districtsPublic and State controlled institutions of higher educationNative American tribal governments (Federally recognized)Public housing authorities/Indian housing authoritiesNative American tribal organizations (other than Federally recognized tribal governments)Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationIndividuals"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":""},{"agency-code":"DOS-SGP"},{"agency-name":"Department of StateU.S. Mission to Singapore"},{"posted-date":"Jan 08, 2020"},{"close-date":"Feb 28, 2020"},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 08, 2020"},{"award-ceiling":"$75,000"},{"award-floor":"$10,000"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":"$75,000"},{"expected-number-of-awards":""},{"description":"The Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in Singapore announces an open competition for proposals to design, plan, and implement a multi-event, multi-platform Olympics-themed public diplomacy initiative in Singapore around the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The Trinity River Restoration Program (TRRP) is a multi-agency effort headquartered in Weaverville, California, with the goal to restore and sustain natural production of anadromous fish populations downstream of Lewiston Dam to pre-dam levels by restoring natural river processes. The strategy to accomplish the TRRP’s goal includes increased flow releases, sediment management and control, mechanical channel rehabilitation, watershed restoration, and an adaptive management program (USDOI, 2000). This approach resulted from years of study that culminated in the Trinity River Flow Evaluation Study (USFWS and HVT, 1999). The Trinity River Flow Evaluation Study’s recommended restoration methods, as well as other alternatives, were subsequently described and fully evaluated in an Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) (USFWS, Reclamation, HVT, and TC, 2000). In the Record of Decision (ROD) (USDOI, 2000), the TRRP was formed to implement the Preferred Alternative as described in the Final EIS/EIR.  This FOA is expected to result in the award of multiple grants or cooperative agreements specifically to help implement the watershed restoration component of the TRRP. The Implementation Plan for the Preferred Alternative of the Trinity River Final EIS/EIR (Implementation Plan) (Stalnaker and Wittler, 2000), explains the impetus for the watershed program plus describes work activities, priorities, and funding sources.

Functionally linking these areas of research will produce programs to enhance the predictive value of preclinical studies based on the use of precision animal models. Centers will create a process by which the research community can nominate unique human genomic variants for a cost effective high-throughput testing in an animal model pipeline. After validation of the expected gene editing, the Centers will establish assays to conduct comprehensive functional and phenotyping analysis to evaluate disease-causing variants. An important mission of the Centers will be the creation and distribution of precision animal model resources and related services to the biomedical community. Therefore, Centers will establish pipelines for preclinical scientific discovery, disease modeling, and development of interventions based on innovative animal models. Because these preclinical pipelines eventually will be an integral part of diagnostics, care and therapeutic treatment of patients, Centers should demonstrate how they intend to achieve this. Even though the Centers will work on a limited number of focused projects, it is expected that the program and pipeline(s) developed by the Center will maintain multifaceted research activities to build core model systems that can be adjusted as required to accommodate a broad spectrum of diseases."},{"version":"2"},{"modification-comments":"updated Expiration date"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Coastal Program - Great Lakes Restoration Initative","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323549","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>F20AS00043</b>","contentSnippet":"F20AS00043","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323549","categories":["ENV|Environment"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323549"},{"opportunity-number":"F20AS00043"},{"opportunity-title":"Coastal Program - Great Lakes Restoration Initative"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Environment"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"15.662"},{"eligible-applicants":"Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":""},{"agency-code":"DOI-FWS"},{"agency-name":"Department of the InteriorFish and Wildlife Service"},{"posted-date":"Jan 10, 2020"},{"close-date":"Sep 30, 2020"},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 10, 2020"},{"award-ceiling":"$200,000"},{"award-floor":"$40,000"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":"$1,000,000"},{"expected-number-of-awards":"10"},{"description":"The Coastal Program is a voluntary, incentive-based program that provides technical and financial assistance to coastal communities and landowners to restore and protect fish and wildlife habitat on public and private lands.

The objective of this research opportunity is to support fundamental (6.1) scientific research programs that will facilitate or enable advances in Naval manufacturing. Preference will be given to Naval-unique or Naval-centric topics that will develop a fundamental understanding of manufacturing processes and/or materials and thereby provide scientific understanding to support advances in the manufacturing technology of Naval components.Background:While the scientific foundations behind most present-day manufacturing technologies have long been established, potential advances in current technologies as well as the development of new manufacturing techniques often require a new scientific knowledge base to provide the foundation for those processes to develop into viable and reliable manufacturing technologies. The Manufacturing Science program addresses the need for fundamental research programs to support these new and novel manufacturing technologies for the Navy.Recent advances in computational modeling capabilities have facilitated the intelligent design of new manufacturing capabilities, the models to predict their performance, and the experimental strategies to best achieve them. These new predictive models can provide powerful benefits for the development of new manufacturing technologies and the capabilities that can be achieved.Program Objectives:The objective of the Manufacturing Science program is to support fundamental scientific research that will help facilitate or enable the advancement/development of manufacturing technologies for Naval components. Research proposals are encouraged to include a modeling component to help direct the research. The focus of the Manufacturing Science program is on Naval manufacturing, preference will be given to Naval-unique or Naval-centric topics. This program has three primary potential focus areas:• Fundamental research programs needed to support significant advances in current Naval manufacturing technologies,• Fundamental research programs supporting new or developing Naval manufacturing technologies, or• Fundamental research programs to design/optimize the materials used in Naval manufacturing technologiesProposers are encouraged to submit research topics within these broad categories that satisfy the program descriptions listed. Some examples of manufacturing technologies and related topics which may have a Naval relevance are large-scale additive manufacturing, surface finishing of additively manufactured components, superior properties arising from additive manufacturing, Naval alloy development for additive manufacturing (i.e., 5083 equivalent), metamorphic manufacturing, and other new manufacturing techniques/technologies. This list is not comprehensive; novel ideas of other manufacturing processes and materials of interest to the Navy are encouraged.The proposal should describe how the proposed program differs from other similar programs."},{"version":"2"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Conducting Public Health Research in Georgia","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323563","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>RFA-GH-20-004</b>","contentSnippet":"RFA-GH-20-004","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323563","categories":["HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323563"},{"opportunity-number":"RFA-GH-20-004"},{"opportunity-title":"Conducting Public Health Research in Georgia"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Health"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.326"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Special Eligibility Requirement: Single Source competition.

The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working to help National Public Health Institutes around the world to meet key International Health Regulations (IHR) requirements. The CDC South Caucasus Office (SCO) was established in 2009 and located in Georgia to train epidemiologists and laboratorians from the region, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine, in both the human and animal sectors as part of the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP). CDC SCO, supported by the Division of Global Health Protection (DGHP), addresses several key global health security priority areas by working in close partnership with the Georgia Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health, and Social Affairs (MoLHSA), National Center for Disease Control and Public Health of Georgia (NCDC), and Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture of Georgia (MEPA). Georgia, together with neighboring countries, Armenia and Azerbaijan, makes up the South Caucasus (SC) region. Despite the challenges of rebuilding after the fall of the Soviet Union and an ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Georgia has persevered and has become a model country for public health and global health security. Georgia and the South Caucasus Region is home to roughly18 million people at risk for emerging infectious diseases, including Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, Anthrax, Brucellosis, and a recently discovered orthopox virus. Due to their livelihood in agriculture or animal husbandry, the local inhabitants are at higher risk of being exposed to the emerging infectious diseases including zoonotic diseases. Additionally there is a high prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), hepatitis C, respiratory disease and other infectious disease threats. US CDC’s work in the South Caucasus and the broader region in collaboration with the L. Sakvarelidze National Centers for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC) demonstrates the true power of regional and international cooperation, commitment to science, and shared motivation to help others. These have always been core principles for the South Caucasus CDC regional office (CDC-SCO) in Georgia and consequently, in 2019, Georgia was selected as a Regional Hub for the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Region. This NOFO is a follow-on to RFA-GH-15-002. It will provide a positive health impact through epidemiologic operational research as well as develop laboratory capacity for emerging infectious. Through earlier detection, more timely prevention and treatment measures can be offered, ultimately leading to lower morbidity and mortality. In the framework of this regional strategy, CDC will achieve its mission to implement a sustainable approach to Global Health Security (GHS) by strengthening NCDC’s ability to prevent, detect and respond rapidly to disease outbreaks."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Radiobiology of High Linear Energy Transfer (High LET) Exposure in Cancer Treatment (R01, Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323572","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>RFA-CA-20-032</b>","contentSnippet":"RFA-CA-20-032","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323572","categories":["ED|Education","HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323572"},{"opportunity-number":"RFA-CA-20-032"},{"opportunity-title":"Radiobiology of High Linear Energy Transfer (High LET) Exposure in Cancer Treatment (R01, Clinical Trial Not Allowed)"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"EducationHealth"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.395"},{"eligible-applicants":"State governmentsCounty governmentsCity or township governmentsSpecial district governmentsIndependent school districtsPublic and State controlled institutions of higher educationNative American tribal governments (Federally recognized)Public housing authorities/Indian housing authoritiesNative American tribal organizations (other than Federally recognized tribal governments)Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationFor profit organizations other than small businessesSmall businessesOthers (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Other Eligible Applicants include the following:  Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISISs); Eligible Agencies of the Federal Government; Faith-based or Community-based Organizations; Hispanic-serving Institutions; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); Indian/Native American Tribal Governments (Other than Federally Recognized); Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Organizations); Regional Organizations; Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) ; U.S. Territory or Possession."},{"agency-code":"HHS-NIH11"},{"agency-name":"Department of Health and Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health"},{"posted-date":"Jan 10, 2020"},{"close-date":"Mar 19, 2020"},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 10, 2020"},{"award-ceiling":"$499,000"},{"award-floor":"$0"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":""},{"expected-number-of-awards":""},{"description":"The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support multidisciplinary research projects that examine the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of high linear energy transfer (high LET) radiation on cell and tissue targets.

This FOA is expected to support up to 4-6 additional PASS as part of the MoTrPAC consortium. Phase 2 of the original PASS study sites will design and conduct detailed mechanistic studies to identify the sources, signaling pathways, physiological targets, and functions of mobilized and identified molecular transducers of physical activity; to recognize feedback and interaction effects among different pathways and tissues; and to discover specific roles of the molecules associated with specific health benefits. This RFA calls for additional proposals to explore the mechanistic links between the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity and functional effects of exercise in tissues. Overall, data from the PASS studies are anticipated to substantially increase our understanding of how different tissues and organs adapt to the exercise induced changes. The PASS will serve to confirm human data and extend the analyses of candidate transducers of physical activity from the clinical study across multiple organs and tissues that are not accessible from human participants. Applicants should propose what they think is the best strategy and approach for investigating how these mobilized compounds synergize to coordinate the overall homeostatic response to exercise. Final decisions on the actual compounds for future screening will be determined in consultation with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Infrastructure for the Expansion of Rhesus macaque Colonies to Support HIV/AIDS-related Research (C06 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323574","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>PAR-20-087</b>","contentSnippet":"PAR-20-087","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323574","categories":["HL|Health"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323574"},{"opportunity-number":"PAR-20-087"},{"opportunity-title":"Infrastructure for the Expansion of Rhesus macaque Colonies to Support HIV/AIDS-related Research (C06 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Health"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"93.352"},{"eligible-applicants":"Public and State controlled institutions of higher educationNonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationNonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher educationOthers (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"Other Eligible Applicants include the following:  Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISISs); Hispanic-serving Institutions; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) ; Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are not eligible to apply.

There are several IUS drug products on the market; however, there have not been any approved Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) so far. The Agency has previously sponsored a grant (RFA-FD-15-006) with the aim to develop a discriminatory dissolution method for this complex drug product. Outcomes from this grant include a reliable IUS preparation method, a real-time dissolution method with discriminatory capability, and an accelerated dissolution method. These achievements now make it possible to conduct a systemic investigation on the impact of critical process parameters (CPP) and formulation variations on the release rate of IUS drug products. This is a grant expansion of RFA-FD-15-006. Upon the completion of this new grant, the results will: 1) deepen the understanding of this complex drug product from a generic drug development perspective, 2) help identify the CPPs and possible formulation variations for this drug product, and 3) inform development of an accurate, sensitive, and less time-consuming BE approach for IUS products.The objective of this study is to identify the CPP and their impact on the critical quality attributes (CQAs), quantitatively determine the impact of manufacturing parameters and formulation variations on the release rate of levonorgestrel of IUSs and estimate acceptable variations on physicochemical properties that do not cause significant changes in drug release rate for this type of complex drug product. The results from this proposed study will further help the Agency to develop PSGs on IUS products and foster the development of generic IUS products.Objectives:(1) To formulate levonorgestrel IUS products that are qualitatively and quantitatively inequivalent in inactive ingredients (non-Q1/Q2) and evaluate the impact of formulation variations on drug release rates. The applicant is also encouraged to develop methods that are capable of discriminating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) from different sources and different crosslinking density of PDMS.(2) To identify CPPs and CQAs for IUS products and evaluate the impact of CPPs on the CQAs and drug release rates.(3) To conduct dissolution studies, both under real time and accelerated conditions, with two commercially available IUS systems (Mirena and Liletta). In addition, identify their excipient differences and CQA differences, correlate those identified differences with their levonorgestrel release rates, and provide sufficient evidence for the Agency to estimate acceptable variations on physicochemical properties that do not cause significant changes in drug release rate for IUS products.Additional detail regarding the study objectives listed above: (1) The intrauterine systems chosen to serve as the reference products for this study include two marketed products, Mirena (levonorgestrel-releasing IUS, 52mg) and Liletta (levonorgestrel-releasing IUS, 52 mg)"},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"American Lobster Research Program","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323581","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>NOAA-OAR-SG-2020-2006355</b>","contentSnippet":"NOAA-OAR-SG-2020-2006355","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323581","categories":["ENV|Environment","NR|Natural Resources","ST|Science and Technology and other Research and Development"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323581"},{"opportunity-number":"NOAA-OAR-SG-2020-2006355"},{"opportunity-title":"American Lobster Research Program"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"EnvironmentNatural ResourcesScience and Technology and other Research and Development"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"11.417"},{"eligible-applicants":"Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":"The following entities are eligible and encouraged to participate in this funding opportunity: any individual; any public or private corporation, partnership, or other association or entity (including any Sea Grant College, Sea Grant Institute or other institution); or any State, political subdivision of a State, Tribal government or agency or officer thereof.

The American lobster fishery is one of the largest and most valuable fisheries along the Atlantic coast. In 2017, the American lobster fishery was the third highest value U.S. commercial species, valued at $594 million, behind salmon and crabs.  Rising ocean temperatures have caused global fish population distribution shifts, and studies suggest warming temperatures may also directly impact the migration, growth, maturity, and natural mortality of American lobster. Of equal concern are potential impacts to lobster larval mortality due to ecosystem and food web changes. Lobster habitat is also changing, although the degree to which is unknown. These changes present threats to the American lobster fishery in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and southern New England. Although lobster populations and landings in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank have been increasing since the late 1990s, young-of-year surveys began showing declines in 2012. The state of Maine, where more than seventy-five percent of lobsters harvested in the US were landed in 2017, continued to see lobster landings decrease below the five-year average in October of 2019. Gaps in scientific knowledge and economic uncertainties, such as recent regulatory adjustments regarding Atlantic herring, a primary bait for lobster, continue to drive the need for research to enhance understanding and investigate how these factors impact the American Lobster fishery."},{"version":"1"}]},{"date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","title":"Summer Seminars and Institutes for K-12 Educators","link":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323576","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 19:15:37 GMT","dc:date":"2020-02-03T19:15:37Z","content":"<b>20200303-FV-ES</b>","contentSnippet":"20200303-FV-ES","guid":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=323576","categories":["HU|Humanities (see \"Cultural Affairs\" in CFDA)"],"isoDate":"2020-02-03T19:15:37.000Z","details":[{"funding-opportunity-id":"323576"},{"opportunity-number":"20200303-FV-ES"},{"opportunity-title":"Summer Seminars and Institutes for K-12 Educators"},{"opportunity-category":"Discretionary"},{"opportunity-category-explanation":""},{"funding-instrument-type":"Grant"},{"category-of-funding-activity":"Humanities (see \"Cultural Affairs\" in CFDA)"},{"category-explanation":""},{"cfda-numbers":"45.163"},{"eligible-applicants":"State governmentsCounty governmentsCity or township governmentsSpecial district governmentsPublic and State controlled institutions of higher educationNative American tribal governments (Federally recognized)Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher educationPrivate institutions of higher education"},{"additional-information-on-eligibility":""},{"agency-code":"NEH"},{"agency-name":"National Endowment for the Humanities"},{"posted-date":"Jan 10, 2020"},{"close-date":"Mar 03, 2020"},{"last-updated-date":"Jan 10, 2020"},{"award-ceiling":"$235,000"},{"award-floor":"$1"},{"estimated-total-program-funding":"$2,000,000"},{"expected-number-of-awards":"12"},{"description":"The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Division of Education Programs is accepting applications for the Summer Seminars and Institutes for K-12 Educators program.
